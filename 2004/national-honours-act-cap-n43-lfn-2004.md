(c)    limiting the number of persons who may, from time to time, be admitted to a particular honour or rank of an honour;

(d)    specifying the designation which a recipient of an honour or rank of an honour, shall be entitled to use and the abbreviations by which reference may be made to such designation;

(e)    prescribing the insignia by which an honour or rank of an honour is to be distinguished;

(c)    by any other means represents himself to be a  person who is or was entitled to the honour or rank, he shall be guilty of an offence and liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months or a fine not exceeding N100 or both.
