(b)    for extra medical care for members of the armed forces and their families where government facilities are either inadequate or not immediately available;

(d)    for making donations as appropriate to other funds or organisations which in the opinion of the Trustees are closely connected with and actively assisting in the war effort of the armed forces; and
