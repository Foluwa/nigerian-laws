140.    (1) If a member fails to pay any call or instalment of a call on the day appointed for payment, the directors may, at any time thereafter during such time as any part of the call or instalment remains unpaid, serve a notice on him requiring payment of so much of the call or instalment as is unpaid, together with any interest which may have accrued. (2) The notice shall name a further day (not earlier than the expiration of 14 days from the date of service of the notice) on or before which the payment required by the notice is to be made, and it shall state that in the event of non-payment at or before the time appointed, the shares in respect of which the call was made shall be liable to be forfeited.

Classes of shares

141.    (1)If at any time the share capital of a company is divided into different classes of shares under section 118 of this Act, the rights attached to any class (unless otherwise provided by the terms of issue of the shares that class) may, whether or not the company is being wound up, be varied with the consent, in writing, of the holders of three-quarters of the issued shares of that class, or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a separate general meeting of the holders of the shares of the class.

(2)      To every such separate general meeting as is mentioned in subsection (1) of this section, the provisions of this Act relating to general meetings shall apply, so however that the necessary quorum shall be two persons at least holding or representing by proxy one-third of the issued shares of the class and that any holder of shares of the class present in person or by proxy may demand a poll.

(3)      If on any such application the court, after hearing the applicant and any other persons applying to it to be heard and appearing to be interested in the application, is satisfied that the variation would unfairly prejudice the shareholders of the class represented by the applicant, the court, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, may disallow the variation, and shall, if not satisfied, confirm the variation.

(4)      The decision of the court on any such application shall be final.

(5)      The company shall, within 15 days after the making of an order by the court on an application to it under this section, forward a copy of the order to the Commission and if default is made in complying with the provisions of this subsection, the company and every officer of the company who is in default shall be liable to a fine of N50 for every during which the default continues.

(6)      In this section, "variation" includes abrogation and cognate expressions shall be constructed accordingly.

143.    (1)Notwithstanding the provisions of section 116 of this Act, the articles may provide that preference shares issued after the commencement of this Act shall carry the rights to attend general meetings and on a poll at the meetings to more than one vote per share in the following circumstances, but not otherwise, that is to say-

(a)      upon any resolution during such period as the preferential dividend or any part of it remains in arrear and unpaid, such starting from a date not more than 12 months or such lesser period as the articles may provide, after the due date of the dividend; or

(b)      Upon any resolution which varies the rights attached to such shares; or

(c)      Upon any resolution to remove an auditor of the company or to appoint another person in place of such auditor; or

(d)      Upon any resolution for the winding up of the company or during the winding up of the company.

(2)     Notwithstanding the provisions of section 116 of this Act, any special resolution of a company increasing the number of shares of any class may validly resolve that any existing class of preference shares shall carry the right to such votes additional to one votes additional to one vote per share as shall be necessary in order to preserve the existing ratio which the votes exercisable by the holders of such preference shares at a general meeting of the company bear to the total votes exercisable at the meeting.

(3)      For the purposes of subsection (2) of this section, a dividend shall be deemed to be due on the date appointed in the articles for the payment of the dividend for any year or other period, or if no such date is appointed, upon the day immediately following the expiration of the year or other period, and whether or not such dividend shall have been earned or declared.

144.    In construing the provisions of a company's articles in respect of the rights attached to shares, the following rules of construction shall be observed-

(a)      Unless the contrary intention appears, no dividend shall be payable on any shares unless the company shall resolve to declare such dividend;

(b)      unless the contrary intention appears, a fixed preferential dividend payable on any class on any class of shares is cumulative, that is to say, no dividend shall be payable on any shares ranking subsequent to them until all the arrears of the fixed dividend have paid;

(c)      Unless the contrary intention appears, in a winding up arrears of any cumulative preferential dividend, whether earned or declared or not are payable up to the date of actual payment in the winding up;

(d)      If any class of shares is expressed to have a right to a preferential dividend, then, unless the contrary intention appears, such class has no further right to participate in dividends;

(e)      if any class of shares is expressed to have preferential rights to payment out of the assets of the company in the event of winding up, then unless the contrary intention appears, such class has no further right to participate in the distribution of assets in the winding up;

(f)      in determining the rights of the various classes to share in the distribution of the company's property on a winding up, no regard shall be paid, unless the contrary intention appears, to whether or not such property represents accumulated profits or surplus which would have been available for dividend while the company remained a going concern;

(g)      Subject to this section, all shares rank equally in all respects unless the contrary intention appears in the company's articles.

Numbering of shares

145.    Each share in a company having a share capital shall be distinguished by its appropriate number: Provided that, if any time all the issued shares in a company, or all of its issued shares of a particular class, are fully paid up and rank pari passu for all purposes, none of those shares need thereafter have a distinguishing number so long as it remains fully paid up and ranks pari passu for all purposes with all shares of the same claim for the time being issued and fully paid up.

Shares certificates

146.    (1)Every company shall, within two months after the allotment of any of its shares and within 3 moths after the date on which a transfer of any such shares is lodged with the company, complete and have ready for delivery the certificates of all shares allotted or transferred, unless the conditions of issue of the shares otherwise provide.

(3)      Every certificate issued by a company shall be under the company's seal and shall specify the shares to which it relates and the amount paid up on them: Provided that in respect of shares held jointly by several persons, the company shall not be bound to issue more than one certificate, and delivery of a certificate for shares to one of several joint holders shall be sufficient delivery to all such holders.

(4)      If a share certificate is defaced, lost or destroyed, it may be replaced on such terms (if any), as to evidence and indemnity and the payment of out of pocket expenses of the company of investigating evidence as the directors think fit.

(5)      If any company on which a notice has been served requiring it to make good any default in complying with the provisions of subsection (1) of this section fails to make good the default within 10 days after the service of the notice, the court may, on the application of the person entitled to have the certificate delivered to him, make an order directing the company and any officer of the company to make good the default with such time as army be specified in the order, and any such order may provide that all costs of and incidental to the application shall be borne by the company or by any officer of the company responsible for the default.

(6)      If default is made in complying with this section, the company and every officer of the company who is default shall be liable to a fine of N50 for every day during which the default continues.

(7)      In this section, "transfer" means a transfer duly stamped and otherwise valid, but does not include a transfer which under this Act, a company is for any reason entitled to refuse to and does not, register.

147.    (1)A certificate, under the common seal of the company, specifying any shares held by any member, shall be prima facie evidence of the title of the member to the shares.

(2)      If any person changes his position to his detriment in good faith on the continued accuracy of the statements made in a certificate, the company shall be stopped from denying the continued accuracy of such statements and shall compensate the person for any loss suffered by him in reliance on them and which he would not have suffered had the statements been or continued to be accurate.

(3)      Nothing contained in subsection (2) of this section shall derogate from any right the company may have to be indemnified by any other person.

148.    The production to a company of any document which is by law sufficient evidence of probate of the will, or letters of administration of the estate, or confirmation as executor, of a deceased person having been granted to some person, shall be accepted by the company as sufficient evidence of the grant, notwithstanding anything in its articles to the contrary.

149.    (1) as from the date of commencement of this Act, no company shall have the power to issue warrants.

(2)      Every company shall within a period of 30 days from the date of commencement of this Act, cancel any share warrants previously issued by it which are still valid on that date and enter in its register of members the names and relevant particulars of the bearers of the share warrants.

(3)      A person whose name is entered in a company's register of members by virtue of subsection (2) of this section, shall be deemed to be a member of the company with effect from the date on which the share warrant thereby cancelled, was issued.

(3)      The holders of stock may transfer the same, or any part of it in the same manner, and subject to the same conditions, as and subject to which the shares from which the stock arose might previous to the conversion have been transferred, or as near to it as circumstances admit; and the directors may, from time to time, fix the minimum amount of stock transferable, so however that such minimum shall not exceed the nominal amount of the shares from which the stock arose.

(4)      The holders of stock shall, according to the amount of stock held by them, have the same rights, privileges and advantages as regards dividends, voting at meeting of the company and other matters as if they held the shares from which the stock arose, but no such privilege or advantage (except participation in the dividends and profit of the company and in the assets on winding up) shall be conferred by an amount of stock which would not, if existing in shares, have conferred that privilege or advantage.

154.    A transfer of the share or other interest of a deceased member of a company made by his personal representative shall, although the personal representative is not himself a member of the company, be as valid as if he had been such a member at the time of the execution of the instrument of transfer.

155.    (1) In case of the death of a member, the survivor or survivors where the deceased was a joint holder, or the legal personal representative of the deceased where he was a sole holder, shall be the only persons recognised by the company as having any title to his interest in the shares; but nothing in this section shall release the estate of a deceased joint holder from any liability in respect of any share which had been jointly held by him with other persons.

(2)      Any person becoming entitled to a share in consequence of the death or bankruptcy of a member may, upon such evidence being produced as may, from time to time, properly be required by the directors and subject as hereafter provided in this section, elect either to be registered himself as holder of the share, or to have some person nominated by him registered as the transferee of the share; but the company shall, in either case, have the same right to decline or suspend registration as they would have had in the case of a transfer of the share by that member before his death or bankruptcy, as the case may be.

(3)      If the person so becoming entitled elects to be registered him, he shall deliver or send to the company a notice in writing signed by him stating that he so elects and if he elects to have another person registered, he shall testify his election by executing to that person a transfer of the share.

(b)      the trustee of the debenture trust deed covering the debentures he holds for compensation for any breach of the duties which the trustee owes him, and in any such action, it shall not be necessary for any other debenture holders of the same class, or if the action is brought against the company, the trustee of the covering trust deed, to be joined as a party.

(3)      This section shall apply notwithstanding anything contained in a debenture trust deed or other instrument but a provision in a debenture or trust deed shall be valid and binding on all the debenture holders of the class convened in so far as it enables a meeting of the debenture holders by a resolution supported by the votes of the holders of at least three quarters in value of the debentures of that class in respect of which votes are cast on the resolution to –

(a)      Release any trustee from liability for any breach of his duties to the debenture holders which he has already committed, or generally from liability for all such breaches (without necessarily specifying them) upon his ceasing to be a trustee; or

Fixed and Floating charges

178.    (1)A floating charge means an equitable charge over the whole or a specified part of the company's undertakings and assets, including cash and uncalled capital of the company both present and future, but so that the charge shall not preclude the company from dealing with such assets until –

(b)      The court appoints a receiver or manager of such assets on the application of the holder; or

(c)     The company goes into liquidation;

179.    A fixed charge on any property shall have priority over a floating charge affecting that property, unless the terms on which the floating charge was granted prohibited the company from granting any later charge having priority over the floating charge and the person in whose favour such later charge was granted had actual notice of that prohibition at the time when the charge was granted to him.

180.    (1) whenever a fixed or floating charge has become enforceable, the court shall have power to appoint a receiver and in the case of a floating charge, a receiver and manager of the assets subject to the charge.

(3)      A receiver or manager shall not be appointed as a means of enforcing debentures not secured by any charge.

181.    Where a receiver or a receiver and manager is appointed by the court, advertisement to this effect shall be made by the receiver or the receiver and manager in the Gazette and in two daily newspapers.

182.    (1) Where a receiver is appointed on behalf of the holders of any debentures of a registered company secured by a floating charge, or possession is taken by, or on behalf of those debenture holders of any property comprising or subject to the charge, then if the company is not at the time in course of being wound up, the debts which in every winding-up are under the provisions relating to preferential payments in part XV of this Act to be paid in priority to all other debts, shall be paid out of any assets coming to the hands of the receiver or other person taking possession as aforesaid in priority to any claim for principal or interest in respect of the debentures.

(2)      In the application of the provisions relating to preferential payments –

(a)      section 494 of this Act shall be construed as if, the provision for payment of accrued holiday remuneration becoming payable on the termination of employment before or by the effect of the winding-up order or resolution, were a provision for payment of such remuneration becoming payable on the termination of employment before or by the effect of appointment of the receiver or possession being taken as aforesaid; and

(b)      the periods of time mentioned therein shall be reckoned from the date of the appointment of the receiver or of possession being taken as aforesaid, as the case may be, and if such date occurred before the commencement of this Act, the provisions relating to preferential payments which would have applied but for this Act, shall be deemed to remain in full force.
