An Act to delimit the Exclusive Economic Zone of Nigeria being an area extending up to 200 nautical miles seawards from the coasts of Nigeria. Within this Zone, and subject to universally recognized rights of other States (including land-locked States), Nigeria would exercise certain sovereign rights especially in relation to the conservation or exploitation of the natural resources (minerals, living species, etc.) of the sea bed, its subsoil and superjacent waters and the right to regulate by law the establishment of artificial structures and installations and marine scientific research, amongst other things.

[2nd October, 1978]               [Commencement. ]

(2)   The provisions of subsection (1) of this section shall not be applicable to the extent that under the provisions of any treaty or other written agreement between Nigeria and any neighbouring territorial State, the Exclusive Zone is agreed to be less than the distance specified in subsection (1) of this section.

2.    Exploitation, etc., of Exclusive Zone

(1)   Without prejudice to the Territorial Waters Act, the Petroleum Act or the Sea Fisheries Act, sovereign and exclusive rights with respect to the exploration and exploitation of the natural resources of the sea bed, subsoil and superjacent waters of the Exclusive Zone shall vest in the Federal Republic of Nigeria and such rights shall be exercisable by the Federal Government or by such Minister or agency as the Government may, from time to time, designate in that behalf either generally or in any special case.

(2)  Subsection(1) of this section shall be subject to the provisions of any treaty to which Nigeria is a party with respect to the exploitation of the living resources of the Exclusive Zone.

3.        Power to erect installations, etc., and offences in relation thereto

(b)           installations and structures.

(2)   The appropriate authority may, for the purpose of protecting any installation in a designated area by order published in the Federal Gazette, prohibit ships, subject to any exceptions provided in the order, from entering without its consent such part of that area as may be specified in such order.

(3)   If any ship enters any part of a designated area in contravention of an order made under this section, its owner or master shall be liable on conviction to a fine of N5,000 or imprisonment for a term of twelve months or to both such fine and imprisonment unless he proves that the prohibition imposed by the order was not, and would not on reasonable inquiry have become, known to the master.

(4)   In this section, "designated area" means any area of the Exclusive Zone so designated by the appropriate authority for the purposes of subsection (1) of this section.

4.           Applicability of criminal and civil laws,etc.

shall be treated for the purposes of that law as taking place in Nigeria.

(2)   Offences under subsection (1) of this section shall be triable by the Federal High Court whether or not such offence would, if actually committed in Nigeria, be triable under the applicable enactment by a court other than the Federal High Court.
