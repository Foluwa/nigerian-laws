(b) shall not apply to a record of part of a work or adaptation unless those previous records were records of, or comprising , that part of the work of a similar adaptation.

9. Nothing in this Schedule shall be construed as authorising the importation of records which could not lawfully be imported apart from this Schedule; and accordingly, for the purposes of any provision of this act relating to imported articles, where the question arises whether the making of a record outside Nigeria would have constituted an infringement of copyright if the record had been made in Nigeria, that question shall be determined as if paragraph 1 of this schedule had not been enacted.

10. In this Schedule "prescribed" means prescribed by Regulations made under this Schedule by the Commission and any such Regulations made for the purpose of sub-paragraph (d) of paragraph 1 of this Schedule may provide that the taking of such steps as the Commission  considers most convenient for ensuring the receipt of the royalties (by the owner of the copyright) shall be treated as constituting payment of the royalties in accordance with that paragraph.
