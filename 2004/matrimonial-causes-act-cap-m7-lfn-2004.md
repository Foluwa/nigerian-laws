(6)  Where an order of the kind specified in subsection (3) (a) of this section made with respect to the maintenance of a wife or of children ceases to have effect under subsection (4) or (5) of this section, the order made may, in so far as it relates to any period before it so ceased to have effect, be enforced as if this Act had not been made.

2. (1) Subject to this Act, a person may institute a matrimonial cause under this Act in the High Court of any State of the Federation; and for that purpose the High Court of each State of the Federation shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine-

16. (1)      Without prejudice to the generality of section 15(2)(c) of this Act, the court hearing a petition for a decree to of dissolution of marriage shall hold that the petitioner has satisfied the court of the fact mentioned in the said section 15(2)(c) of this Act if the petitioner satisfies the court that-

(b)    since the marriage, the respondent has, for a period of not less than two years-

(i)     having attempted to murder or unlawfully to kill the petitioner, or

(ii)    having committed an offence involving the intentional infliction of grievous harm or grievous hurt on the petitioner or the intent to inflict grievous harm or grievous hurt on the petitioner;

(f)     orthe respondent has habitually and wilfully failed, throughout the period of two years immediately preceding the date of the petition, to pay maintenance for the petitioner-

(i)     ordered to be paid under an order of, or an order registered in, a court in the Federation, or

(ii)    agreedto be paid under an agreement between the parties to the marriage providing for their separation; or

(g)    the respondent-

(i)     is, at the date of the petition, of unsound mind and unlikely to recover, and

(ii)    sincethe marriage and within the period of six ears immediately preceding the date of the petition, as been confined for a period of, or for periods aggregating, not less than five years in an institution where persons may be confined for unsoundness of mind in accordance with law, or in more than one such institution.

(2)    Where a petition is based on the fact mentioned in section 15(2) (h) of this Act-

(a)    proofthat, for a period of seven years immediately preceding the date of the petition, the other party to the marriage was continually absent from the petitioner and that the petitioner has no reason to believe that the other party was alive at any time within that period is sufficient to establish the fact in question, unless it is shown that the other party to the marriage was alive at a time within that period; and

(b)    a decree made pursuant to the petition shall be in the form of a decree of dissolution of marriage by reason of presumption of death.

17. (1)      Where the petitioner alleges that the respondent has behaved in such a way that the petitioner cannot reasonably be  expected to live with him but the parties to the marriage have lived with each other for a period or periods after the date of the occurrence of the final incident relied on by the petitioner and held by the court to support his allegation, that fact shall be disregarded in determining for the purposes of section 15(2)(c) of this Act whether the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent if the length of that period or of those periods together was six months or less.

(2)    Inconsidering for the purposes of section 15(2) of this Act whether the period for which the respondent has deserted the petitioner or the period for which the parties to a marriage have lived apart has been continuous, no account shall be taken of any one period (not exceeding six months) or of any two or more periods (not exceeding six months in all) during which the parties resumed living with each other, but no period during which the parties lived with each other shall count as part of the period of desertion or of the period for which the parties to the marriage lived apart, as the case may be.

(3)  Referencesin this section to the parties to a marriage living with each other shall be construed as references to their living with each other in the same household.

18. A married person whose conduct constitutes just cause or excuse for the other party to the marriage to live separately or apart, and occasions that other party to live separately or apart, shall be deemed to have wilfully deserted that other party without just cause or excuse, notwithstanding that that person may not in fact have intended the conduct to occasion that other party to live separately or apart.

19. (1)      Where husband and wife are parties to an agreement for separation, whether oral, in writing or constituted by conduct, the refusal by one of them, without reasonable justification, to comply with the other's bona fide request to resume cohabitation shall constitute, as from the date of the refusal, wilful desertion without just cause or excuse on the part of the party so refusing.

(2)           For the purposes of this section, "reasonable justification" means justification that is reasonable in all the circumstances, including the conduct of the other party to the marriage since the marriage, whether that conduct took place before or after the agreement for separation.

20. Where a party to a marriage has been wilfully deserted by the other party, the desertion shall not be deemed to have been terminated by reason only that the deserting party has become incapable of forming or having an intention to continue the desertion, if it appears to the court that the desertion would probably have continued if the deserting party had not become so incapable.

21. The court shall not find that a respondent has wilfully and persistently refused to consummate the marriage unless the court is satisfied that, as at the commencement of the hearing of the petition, the marriage had not been consummated.

22. Where-

(a)  a person has been sentenced to imprisonment in respect of each of two or more crimes that, in the opinion of the court hearing the petition, arose substantially out of the same acts or omissions; and

(b)  the sentences were ordered to be served, in whole or in part, concurrently, then, in reckoning for the purposes of section 16(l) (c) of this Act the period for which that person has been sentenced in the aggregate, any period during which two or more of those sentences were to be served concurrently shall be taken into account once only.

23. A finding in accordance with section 16(l) (f) of this Act shall not be made unless the court is satisfied that reasonable attempts have been made by the petitioner to enforce the order or agreement under which maintenance was ordered or agreed to be paid.

24. A finding in accordance with section 16(l) (g) of this Act shall not be made unless the court is satisfied that, at the commencement of the hearing of the petition, the respondent was still confined in an institution referred to in the said section 16(l) (g) and was unlikely to recover.

25. On the application of the respondent made in the course of proceedings for a decree of dissolution of marriage, the court may, if it considers it just and proper in the circumstances of the case to make provision for the maintenance of the respondent or other provision for the benefit of the respondent, refuse to make a decree unless and until it is satisfied that the petitioner has made arrangements satisfactory to the court to provide the maintenance or other benefit as aforesaid upon the decree becoming absolute.

26. Except where section 16(l) (g) of this Act applies, a decree of dissolution of marriage shall not be made if the petitioner has condoned or connived at the conduct constituting the facts on which the petition is based.

27. A decree of dissolution of marriage shall not be made if the petitioner, in bringing or prosecuting the proceedings, has been guilty of Collusion with intent to cause a perversion of justice.

28. The court may, in its discretion, refuse to make a decree of dissolution of marriage if since the marriage-

(a)  the petitioner has committed adultery that has not been condoned by the respondent or, having been so condoned, has been revived;

(b)  the petitioner has wilfully deserted the respondent before the happening of the matters relied upon by the petitioner or, where those matters involve other matters occurring during, or extending over, a period, before the expiration of that period; or

(c)  the habits of the petitioner have, or the conduct of the petitioner has, conduced or contributed to the existence of the matters relied upon by the petitioner.

29.    Where both a petition for a decree of nullity of a marriage and a petition for a decree of dissolution of that marriage are before a court, the court shall not make a decree of dissolution of the marriage unless it has dismissed the petition for a decree of nullity of the marriage.

30.    (1)    Subjectto this section, proceedings for a decree of dissolution of marriage shall not be instituted within two years after the date of the marriage except by leave of the court.

(2)    Nothingin this section shall apply to the institution of proceedings based on any of the matters specified in section 15(2) (a) or (b) or 16(l) (a) of this Act, or to the institution of proceedings for a decree of dissolution of marriage by way of cross-proceedings.

(3)    Thecourt shall not grant leave under this section to institute proceedings except on the ground that to refuse to grant the leave would impose exceptional hardship on the applicant or that the case is one involving exceptional depravity on the part of the other party to the marriage.

(4)    Indetermining an application for leave to institute proceedings under this section, the court shall have regard to the interest of any children of the marriage, and to the question whether there is any reasonable probability of reconciliation between the parties before the expiration of the period of two years after the date of the marriage.

(5)  Where, at the hearing of proceedings that have been instituted by leave of the court under this section, the court is satisfied that the leave was obtained by misrepresentation or concealment of material facts, the court may-

(a)    adjourn the hearing for such period as the court thinks fit; or

(b)    dismiss the petition on the ground that the leave was so obtained.

(6)    Where,in a case to which subsection (5) of this section applies, there is a cross-petition, if the court adjourns or dismisses the petition under that subsection, it shall also adjourn for the same period, or dismiss, as the case may be, the cross-petition; but if the court, having regard to the provisions of this section, thinks it proper to hear and determine the cross-petition, it may do so, and in that case it shall also hear and determine the petition.
