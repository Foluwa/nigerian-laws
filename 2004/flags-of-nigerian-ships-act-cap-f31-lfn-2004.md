Flags as evidence of nationality of Nigerian ships, other than ships of the Nigerian Navy or Naval Reserve to be worn on all lawful occasion, shall be classed as ensigns distinguished by the colour of their respective grounds; and-

(a)      for ships owned by any of the Governments of Nigeria, the flag shall have a blue ground with the national flag filling the top left-hand corner and quarter of the hoist, and be known as the blue ensign;

(b)      for ships other than those owned by any of the Governments of Nigeria, the flag shall have a red ground with the national flag filling the top left-hand corner and quarter of the hoist, and be known as the red ensign, and unless regulations made under this Act otherwise prescribe, a ship affected by this subsection shall display the ensign appropriate to be worn by it.

2.        Naval white ensign

(1)      It is hereby declared for the avoidance of doubt that the Minister of Defence may prescribe the flag to be worn by vessels of the Nigerian Navy or of the Naval Reserve and until so prescribed that flag shall have a white ground, with the red cross of St. George quartered thereon and the national flag in the top left-hand quadrant; and the flag shall in either event be known as the white ensign and as such shall be worn by vessels aforesaid on such naval occasions as may, from time to time, be prescribed according to custom and usage.

(2)      In this section, "vessels" includes craft of any description under naval control.

3.        Offence of improper flying

The flying on land of any ensign for use under this Act, or otherwise than on board a ship for which it is prescribed, without the prior approval in the case of the blue or the red ensign, of the Minister of Transport, or in the case of the white ensign, of the Minister of Defence shall be an offence punishable on conviction by a fine of two hundred naira or by imprisonment for a term of twelve months, or both.
