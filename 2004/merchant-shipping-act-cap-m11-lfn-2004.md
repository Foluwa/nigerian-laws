The burden of proving the loss or damage sustained in accordance with the provisions of this Part of this Act shall be upon the claimant and damages shall not be recoverable to the extent that the person against whom the claim is made is able to show that the claimant could have avoided or mitigated the loss or damage by the exercise of reasonable diligence.
