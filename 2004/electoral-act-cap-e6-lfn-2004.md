(a)    disallowance of any costs, charges or expenses, which may in the opinion of the Tribunal or Court have been caused by vexatious conduct, unfounded allegation or unfounded objection on the part of the petitioner or of the respondent, as the case may be; and

(b)    discouragement of any needless expenses by throwing the burden of defraying the expenses on the party by whom it has been caused; whether that party is or is not on the whole successful.

(2)    Where the Tribunal or Court declares an election to be void, it may, if satisfied that the invalidity was due either wholly or in part to the culpable default of an officer responsible for the conduct of the election in the performance of his duties, order that the whole or part of the cost awarded to the successful petitioner be paid by that officer.

RETURN OF SECURITY

39.    Money deposited as security shall, when no longer needed as security for costs, charges or expenses, be returned to the person in whose name it was deposited or to the person entitled to receive it by order of the Tribunal or Court which may be made on motion after notice and proof that all just claims have been satisfied or otherwise sufficiently provided for as the Tribunal or Court may require.

PAYMENT OF COSTS OUT OF SECURITY

40.    (1) The Tribunal or Court may, on application made by a person to whom costs, charges or expenses is payable, order it to be paid out of a deposit made to secure it, after notice to the party by or on whose behalf the deposit was made, requiring him to file a statement within a specified time whether he opposes the application and the ground of his opposition.

(2)    Where a dispute arises on an application under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the tribunal or court shall afford every person affected by the dispute an opportunity of being heard and shall make such order there on as it may deem fit.

(3)    A person shall be deemed to have been afforded the opportunity of being heard if notice of the appointed time for the inquiry into the dispute was given to him, though the person may not have been present at the making of the inquiry.

(4)    A notice to be given to a person under this paragraph may be given by the Secretary handing him the notice or sending it to him by registered letter in the case of-

(a)    a party, at the address for service;

(b)    an application for payment, at the address given in his application, so however, that the provisions of this subparagraph shall not preclude the giving of notice in any other manner in which notice may be given or which may be authorized by the tribunal or court.

(5)    Execution may be levied under an order for payment made by the tribunal or court under this paragraph in the same manner and to the same extent as execution may be levied under judgment for the payment of money.

(7)    The Tribunal or Court may, at or before the hearing of a petition order or direct that the number of witnesses who may be called at the hearing be limited as specified by the order or direction.

(8)    Save with leave of the Tribunal or Court, after an applicant has shown exceptional circumstances, no document, plan, photograph or model shall be received in evidence at the hearing of a petition unless it has been listed or filed along with the petition in the case of the petitioner or filed along with the reply in the case of the respondent.

(9)    Such leave may be granted with costs save where in the circumstance the tribunal or court considers otherwise.

CALLING OF WITNESSES

42. (1)       On the hearing of an election petition, the Tribunal or Court may summon a person as a witness who appears to the tribunal or court to have been concerned in the election.

(3)    The expenses of a witness called by the tribunal or court at its own instance shall, unless the Tribunal or Court otherwise orders, be deemed to be costs of the election petition and may, if the Tribunal or Court so directs, be paid in the first instance by the Secretary in the same way as State witness' expenses and recovered in such manner as the tribunal or court may direct.

(4)    Where the Tribunal or Court summons a person as a witness under this paragraph, the provisions of the Civil Procedure Rules relating to the expenses of persons ordered to attend a hearing shall apply as if they were part of this paragraph.

(5)    The Tribunal or Court shall-

(b)    in the examination of any witness who produces or will produce a document, ensure that the way in which the vote of a particular person has been given shall not be disclosed.

PRIVILEGES OF A WITNESS

43.    (1) A person called as a witness in a proceeding in the Tribunal or Court shall not be excused from answering a question relating to an offence or connected with an election on the grounds that the answer thereto may incriminate or tend to incriminate him, or on the ground of privilege.

(2)    A witness who answers truly all questions which he is required by the tribunal or court to answer shall be entitled to receive a certificate of indemnity under the hand of the Chairman or the Tribunal or Presiding Justice of the court stating that the witness has so answered.

(3)    An answer by a person to a question before the Tribunal or Court shall not, except in the case of a criminal proceeding for perjury in respect of the answer, be admissible in any proceeding, civil or criminal, in evidence against him.

(4)    When a person has received a certificate of indemnity in relation to an election and legal proceedings are at any time brought against him for an offence against the provisions of this Act, committed by him prior to the date of the certificate at or in relation to that election, the Tribunal or Court having cognizance of the case shall, on proof of the certificate, stay the proceeding, and may, at its discretion award to that person such costs as he may have been put to in the proceeding.

(3)    When the time for delivering a pleading or document or filing any affidavit, answer or document, or doing anything or act is or has been fixed or limited by any of the sections, paragraphs or rules under or in pursuance of this Act or by a direction or an order of the Tribunal or Court, the costs of an application to extend the time, where allowed or of an order made there on shall be borne by the party making the application unless the tribunal or court otherwise orders.

(4)    Every application for enlargement or abridgement of time shall be supported by affidavit.

(5)    An application for abridgement of time may be ex parte, but the Tribunal or Court may require notice of the application to be given to the other parties to the election petition.

(6)    An application for enlargement of time shall be made by motion after notice to the other party to the election petition but the Tribunal or Court may, for good cause shown by affidavit or otherwise, dispense with the notice.

(2)    When a petition comes up for hearing, if the petitioner appears and the respondent does not appear the petitioner may prove his petition so far as the burden of proof lies upon him and the tribunal or court shall enter a final judgment in the petition.

(4)    Documentary evidence shall be put in and may be read or taken as read by consent.

(5)    A party shall close his case when he has concluded his evidence and either the petitioner or respondent may make oral application to have the case closed.

(7)    The Secretary shall take charge of every document or object put in as exhibit during the hearing of a petition and shall mark or label every exhibit with a letter or letters indicating the party by whom the exhibit is put in (or where more convenient the witness by whom the exhibit is proved) and with a number so that all the exhibits put in by a party (or proved by a witness) are numbered in one consecutive series.

(8)    The Secretary shall cause a list of all the exhibits in the petition to be made which when completed shall form part of the record of the proceedings.

(2)    After a party has given an address for service it shall be sufficient if, in lieu of serving him personally with a document intended for him, the document is served on the person-

(a)    appearing on the paper last filed on his behalf as his Solicitor wherever the person may be found or, if the person is not found at his office, on the clerk there apparently in charge; or

(b)    named as occupier in his address for service wherever the person may be found or, if the person is not found at the address, on-

(a)    order that service be effected in any of the ways mentioned in the provisions of the Civil Procedure Rules relating to substituted service which service shall be sufficient; or

(b)    dispense with service or notice as the tribunal or court deems fit.

TWO OR MORE CANDIDATES AS RESPONDENTS

49.    Two or more candidates may be made respondents to the same petition and their case may, for the sake of convenience be heard at the same time but for all purposes (including the taking of security) the election petition shall be deemed to be a separate petition against each of the respondents.

CONSOLIDATED PETITIONS

50.    Where two or more petitions are presented in relation to the same election or return, all the petitions shall be consolidated, considered and be dealt with as one petition unless the Tribunal or Court shall otherwise direct in order to do justice or an objection against one or more of the petitions has been upheld by the Tribunal or Court.

(2)    If consent is withheld by the Attorney-General under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph the Government of the Federation shall indemnify the Electoral Officer, Presiding Officer, Returning Officer or such other official of the Commission against any costs which may be awarded against him by the Tribunal or Court in respect of the election petition.

(4)    A private Legal Practitioner engaged by the Commission under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph shall be entitled to be paid his professional fees and a Legal Officer so engaged shall be paid such honorarium as may be approved by the Commission.

DUPLICATE OF DOCUMENT

52.    In the absence of express provision in this Schedule, a party filing any document or process paper in connection with any step being taken in the proceedings of an election petition shall, unless the Secretary otherwise directs, leave with the Secretary copies of the document or process paper for service on each of the parties to the election petition in addition to three copies which the Secretary may preserve.

NONCOMPLIANCE WITH RULES, ETC.

53.    (1) Noncompliance with any of the provisions of this Schedule, or with a rule of practice for the time being operative, except otherwise stated or implied, shall not render any proceeding void, unless the Tribunal or Court so directs, but the proceeding may be set aside wholly or in part as irregular, or amended, or otherwise dealt with in such manner and on such terms as the Tribunal or Court may deem fit and just.

(2)    An application to set aside an election petition or a proceeding resulting there from for irregularity or for being a nullity, shall not be allowed unless made within a reasonable time and when the party making the application has not taken any fresh step in the proceedings after knowledge of the defect.

54.    Subject to the express provisions of this Act, the practice and procedure of the Tribunal or the Court in relation to an election petition shall be as nearly as possible, similar to the practice and procedure of the Federal High Court in the exercise of its civil jurisdiction, and the Civil Procedure Rules shall apply with such modifications as may be necessary to render them applicable having regard to the provisions of this Act, as if the petitioner and the respondent were respectively the plaintiff and the defendant in an ordinary civil action.

PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE OF COURT OF APPEAL AND SUPREME COURT

55.    Subject to the provisions of this Act, an appeal to the Court of Appeal or to the Supreme Court shall be determined in accordance with the practice and procedure relating to civil appeals in the Court of Appeal or of the Supreme Court, as the case may be, regard being had to the need for urgency on electoral matters.
