[1st October, 1974]

[Commencement.]

Industrial Wages Boards

1.    Establishment of industrial wages boards

(1)   The Minister may by order direct that an industrial wages board be established to perform, in relation to the workers described in the order and their employers, the functions specified in the subsequent provisions of this Act, if he is of the opinion that wages are unreasonably low or that no adequate machinery exists for the effective regulation of wages or other conditions of employment of those workers:

Provided that no such order shall be made in respect of local government workers.

(2)   The Minister shall, in any order establishing an industrial wages board under this section, determine the area with respect to which the board may exercise any of its powers and perform any of its duties.

2.    Exercise of powers in the States

(1)   If and so long as no order by the Minister subsists under section 1 the appropriate authority in a State may, after consultation with the Minister, make an order within the State to the like extent and subject to the same conditions as an order of the Minister under that section, and the appropriate authority may make such an order in respect of local government workers in the State.

(2)   If and so long as an order of the appropriate authority under subsection (1) of this section subsists, the Minister shall not make an order for the establishment of an industrial wages board in the State as prescribed by section (1) of this Act.

(3)   The appropriate authority for a State shall be the Governor or such member of the Executive Council of the State as may be appointed by order of the Governor to be the appropriate authority for the purposes of this section.

(4)   Where the appropriate authority in a State is enabled to exercise powers under this section, the expressions “Minister” and “Federal Gazette” in sections 3 to 15 of this Act shall be construed as references to the appropriate authority and the State Gazette, respectively.

3.    References to commission of inquiry

Without prejudice to section 1 of this Act, the Minister, if he is of the opinion that wages are unreasonably low or that no adequate machinery exists for the effective regulation of wages or other conditions of employment of any workers, may refer to a commission of inquiry the question whether an industrial wages board should be established with respect to any of those workers and their employers.

4.    Procedure of commission of inquiry

(1)   Where the Minister refers to a commission of inquiry under section 3 of this Act the question whether an industrial wages board should be established, and the commission is of opinion with respect to the workers with whom it is concerned—

(a)   that wages are not unreasonably low; or

(b)   that there exists adequate machinery for regulating the wages or other conditions of employment of those workers, and that there is no reason to believe that the machinery is likely to cease to exist or cease to be adequate for that purpose, the commission shall report to the Minister accordingly and may include in its report any suggestions which it may think fit to make as to the improvement of that machinery.

(2)   Where any such suggestions are so included, the Minister may take such steps as appear to him to be expedient and practicable to secure the improvements in question.

(3)   If the commission is of opinion with respect to the workers with whom it is concerned that—

(a)   wages are unreasonably low; or

(b)   adequate machinery for regulating the wages or other conditions of employment does not exist; or

(c)   existing machinery is likely to cease to exist or cease to be adequate for that purpose, and that as a result reasonable standards of wages or other conditions of employment are not being or will not be maintained, the commission may make a report to the Minister accordingly and may include in its report a recommendation (in this Act referred to as “an industrial wages board recommendation”) for the establishment of an industrial wages board in respect of those workers and their employers.

(4)   Where the Minister receives an industrial wages board recommendation, he may, subject to this Act, if he thinks fit, make an industrial wages board order giving effect to the recommendation.

5.    Making of industrial wages board order

(1)   The Minister shall, before making any industrial wages board order, whether under section 4 of this Act or not, publish a notice in the Federal Gazette of his intention to make the order.

(2)   The notice published under subsection (1) of this section shall contain the text of the proposed order, and shall specify the time, being not more than forty days from the date of publication, within which an objection with respect to the order shall be made to the Minister.

(3)   The Minister may make rules with respect to the notice to be given of any matter under this Act with a view to bringing the matter of which the notice is to be given so far as practicable to the knowledge of the persons concerned.

(4)   Every objection made pursuant to subsection (2) of this section shall be in writing and shall state—

(a)   the specific grounds of the objection; and

(b)   the omissions, additions or modifications asked for, and the Minister shall consider any such objection made by or on behalf of any person appearing to him to be affected, being an objection sent to him  within the time specified in the notice, but shall not be bound to consider any other objections.

(5)   After considering all the objections which, under this section, he is required to consider, the Minister may—

(a)   make the order without amendments; or

(b)   make the order with such amendments as he considers necessary or expedient; or

(c)   refrain from making the order.

(6)   Where the Minister makes an industrial wages board order, he shall publish it (and the report of any commission of inquiry relating to the order) in the Federal Gazette, and the order shall come into operation on the date on which it is so published or on such later date as may be specified therein.

6.    Abolition of industrial wages board

If at any time the Minister considers that the wages or other conditions of employment of workers to whom an industrial wages board order relates or the machinery for the regulation of those wages or conditions have been so altered as to render the industrial wages board unnecessary, he may by order abolish the industrial wages board in question; and section 5 of this Act shall apply in relation to any such order as it applies in relation to industrial wages board orders.

7.    General provisions as to commissions of inquiry

(1)   Where any question or other matter is referred under section 3 of this Act to a commission of inquiry, the commission shall—

(a)   make all such investigations as appear to it to be necessary;

(b)   publish a notice stating the terms of the reference and specifying a period (not being less than forty days from the date of publication) within which it will consider representations with respect to the reference made to it in writing; and

(c)   consider any such representations and, if it thinks fit, hear oral evidence.

(2)   Where the Minister receives any report from a commission of inquiry he may, if he thinks fit, refer the report back to the commission, and the commission shall thereupon reconsider it having regard to any observations made by the Minister and shall make a further report; and the like proceeding may take place on receipt of any further report from the commission in the same manner.

8. Wages

(1)   Subject to this section, any industrial wages board may recommend the wages to be paid by the employers to their workers described in the order establishing the said industrial wages board.

(2)   Before recommending any wages under subsection (1) of this section, the industrial wages board shall—

(a)   publish a notice of the wages it proposes to recommend and the manner in which and the time (not being less than forty days from the date of the notice) in which objections to the recommendation may be lodged; and

(b)   consider any objections which may be lodged in accordance with the notice.

(3)   An industrial wages board may, if the board thinks it expedient to do so, recommend the cancellation or variation of any wages fixed under section 10 of this Act, whether an application is made for the purpose or not.

(4)   Where it is proposed to recommend the cancellation or variation of wages fixed under section 10 of this Act, the provisions of this section as to notice shall apply in the same manner as they apply where it is proposed to recommend the said wages.

9.    Conditions of employment other than wages

(1)   An industrial wages board may, if the Minister has given his permission for the board to consider the making of a recommendation for a condition or conditions of employment other than wages, either generally or for any particular work, make such a recommendation for the workers to whom the said industrial wages board refers.

(2)   Before recommending any condition of employment under subsection (1) of this section, the industrial wages board shall—

(a)   publish a notice of the condition which it proposes to recommend and the manner in which and the time (not being less than forty days from the date of the notice) in which objections to the recommendation may be lodged; and

(b)   consider any objections which may be lodged in accordance with the notice.

(3)   An industrial wages board may, if the board thinks it expedient to do so, recommend the cancellation or variation of any condition of employment fixed under section 10 of this Act, whether an application is made for the purpose or not.

(4)   Where it is proposed to recommend the cancellation or variation of a condition fixed under section 10 of this Act, the provisions of this section as to notice shall apply in the same manner as they apply where it is proposed to recommend the said condition.

10. Provisions as to orders fixing wages and other conditions

(1)   Where an industrial wages board has recommended any wages or any other condition of employment, or the cancellation or variation of any such wages or condition fixed under subsection (2) of this section, the board shall forthwith send notification thereof to the Minister; and the notification may include a statement of the date from which the board recommends that the wages or condition, or the cancellation or variation, as the case may be, shall become effective.

(2)   The Minister, on receipt of a notification under this section with respect to any matter, shall by order fix the wages or condition or conditions, or approve the cancellation or variation, as the case may be:

Provided that—

(a)   the Minister may, if he thinks fit, refer the recommendation back to the industrial wages board;

(b)   the board shall thereupon reconsider it having regard to any observations made by the Minister and may, if it thinks fit, re-submit the recommendations to the Minister either without amendment or with such amendments as it thinks fit, having regard to those observations; and

(c)   where recommendations are so re-submitted, the like proceedings shall be had thereon as in the case of original recommendations.

(3)   Any such wages or conditions as aforesaid, or the cancellation or variation of any such wages or conditions, shall become effective from such date (being the date of the order by which they are fixed or approved or a subsequent date) as is specified in that behalf in the order.

(4)   Wages and conditions fixed under this section are hereafter in this Act referred to as “statutory minimum wages” or “statutory minimum conditions”.

11. Saving as to rights under other laws

No order made under section 10 of this Act shall have effect so as to prejudice any rights touching conditions of employment, holidays or wages conferred upon any worker by or under any other enactment or other written law.

12. Employers’ obligations in respect of orders fixing statutory minimum wages or other conditions

(1)   Where any statutory minimum wages have become effective under section 10 of this Act, an employer shall, in cases to which the statutory minimum wages are applicable, pay to the worker wages not less than the statutory minimum wages, clear of all deductions (except any deductions required by law or deductions in respect of contributions to provident or pension funds or schemes agreed to by the workers and approved by the Governor of the appropriate State);and, if the employer fails to do so, he shall be guilty of an offence and on conviction  shall be liable to a fine not exceeding N200 and in the case of a continuing offence to a fine not exceeding N50 for each day or period during which the offence continues.

(2)   On the conviction of an employer under this section for failing to pay to a worker wages less than the statutory minimum wages, the court may by the conviction adjudge the employer convicted to pay, in addition to any fine, such sum as appears to the court to be due to the worker on account of wages, the wages being calculated on the basis of the statutory minimum wages, but the power to order payment on account of wages under this provision shall not be in derogation of the right of the worker to recover wages due to him by any other proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction.

(3)   Where any statutory minimum condition of employment, not being statutory minimum wages, has become effective under section 10 of this Act, an employer shall, in cases to which the statutory minimum condition is applicable, apply to the worker a condition not less favourable to the worker than the statutory minimum condition; and, if the employer fails to do so, he shall be guilty  of an offence and on conviction shall be liable to a fine not exceeding N200 and in the case of a continuing offence to a fine not exceeding N50 for each day or period during which the offence continues.

(4)   On the conviction of an employer under this section for failing to apply to a worker any condition of employment not less favourable to the worker than the statutory minimum condition, the court may by the conviction adjudge the employer convicted to pay, in addition to any fine, such sum by way of compensation as may appear to the court to be due to the worker by reason of the failure, but the power to order the payment of that sum under this provision  shall not be in derogation of any right of the worker to recover any such sum as may  be due to him by any other proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction.

(5)   Where the immediate employer of any worker to whom any statutory minimum wages or any other statutory condition of employment applies is himself in the employment of some other person and the worker is employed on the premises of that other person, that other person shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to be the employer of the worker jointly with the immediate employer.

(6)   Any agreement for the payment of wages or the application of any other condition of employment in contravention of the provisions of this section shall be void.

13. Permit of exemption for workers affected by infirmity or physical injury

(1)   If the Minister is satisfied that any worker employed, or desiring to be employed, in an occupation to which statutory minimum wages are applicable is affected by any infirmity or physical injury which renders him incapable of earning the statutory minimum wages, the Minister may, if he thinks fit, grant to the worker (subject to such conditions, if any, as he may impose) a permit exempting the worker from the provisions of this Act relating to the payment of wages less than the statutory minimum wages; and, while the permit is in force and any conditions imposed thereon are complied with, the employer shall not be guilty of an offence if he pays to the worker less wages than the statutory minimum wages.

(2)   A permit granted under this section may be so granted as to have effect from the date on which the application therefore was made to the Minister, and may be suspended or revoked at any time by the Minister.

14. Duties of industrial wages board in relation to references by the Minister

Any industrial wages board shall consider, as occasion requires, any matter referred to it by the Minister with reference to the conditions of employment of the workers in respect of whom and in respect of whose employers the board has been appointed, and shall make a report thereon to the Minister.

15. Employer to keep records

It shall be the duty of every employer of workers in respect of whom an industrial wages board has been made or a notice has been published under section 5 (1) of this Act—

(a)   to keep such records of wages or conditions of employment as are necessary to show that the provisions of this Act are being complied with as respects persons in his employment, and to retain the records for a period of three years after the period to which they refer; and

(b)   to cause to be kept posted in some conspicuous place at or near the place of employment of persons in his employment in such manner and in such form as may be approved by the Minister—

(i)    a copy of every notice relating to wages or conditions of employment of the aforesaid workers which is published by an industrial wages board as required by this Act and a copy of every order made by the Minister relating to the wages or conditions of employment of the said workers; or

(ii)   such abstract from every such notice or order as the Minister may approve, and, if he fails to do so, he shall be guilty of an offence and on conviction shall be liable to a fine not exceeding N100 and to a daily penalty not exceeding N10.

(3)   An appointed officer may—

(a)   require the production by an employer of wages sheets or other records of wages and records of conditions of employment, and inspect and examine them and copy any part thereof;

(b)   at all reasonable times enter any premises at  which any employer to whom an order made under section 10 of this Act applies carries on his business (including any premises which the officer has reasonable cause to believe to be used by or by arrangement with the employer to provide living accommodation for workers);

(c)   examine, either alone or in the presence of any other person, as he thinks fit, with respect to any matters under this Act, any person whom he has reasonable cause to believe to be or to have been a worker to whom an order made under section 10 of this Act applies or applied, or the employer of any person or a servant or agent of the employer, employed in the employer’s business, and require every such person to be so examined and to sign a declaration of the truth of the matters in respect of which he is so examined, so however that no person shall be required to give any information tending to incriminate himself;

(d)   order any person or body of persons found to have contravened any of the provisions of this Act to take remedial action  within a specified reasonable period of time; and

(e)   subject generally to the powers of any Attorney-General, institute proceedings for any offence under this Act and, with the consent of the Minister, appear and have all necessary power for the conduct of the proceedings; and

Attorney-General means Attorney-General of the Federation or, as appropriate, Attorney-General or Solicitor-General of a State, as the case may be.

(4)   An appointed officer who is authorised in that behalf by general or special directions of the Minister may, if it appears to him that a sum is due from an employer to a worker to whom an order made under section 10 of this Act applies, or to a person who has been such a worker, on account of the payment to him of wages less than the statutory minimum wages, institute on behalf and in the name of that worker or person civil proceedings for the recovery of that sum, and in any such proceedings the court may make an order for the payment of costs by the appointed officer as if he were a party to the proceedings.

(5)   The power given by subsection (4) of this section for the recovery of a sum due from an employer to a worker or other person shall not be in derogation of any right of that worker or other person himself to recover that sum by civil proceedings.

(6)   The Minister may by writing under his hand without prejudice to the foregoing subsection 1 of this section, delegate to any public officer the exercise of the power conferred on the Minister by subsection (3) (e) or (4) of this section:

Provided that the existence of such a delegation shall not prevent the continued exercise of the power by the Minister.

22. Offences by agent, etc.

(1)   Where an offence for which an employer is by virtue of this Act liable to penalty has in fact been committed by some agent of the employer or by some other person, that agent or other person shall be liable to be proceeded against for the offence in the same manner as if he were the employer, and either together with or before or after the conviction of the employer, and shall be liable on conviction to the same penalty as that to which the employer is liable.
