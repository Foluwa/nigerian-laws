[Commencement]       [1st December 1971]

Patents

1.     (1)    Subject to this section, an invention is patentable-

(a)    if it is new, results from inventive activity and is capable of industrial application; or

(b)    if it constitutes an improvement upon a patented invention and also is new, results       from inventive activity and is capable of industrial application.

(2)    For the purposes of subsection (1) of this section-

(a)    aninvention is new if it does not form part of the state of the art,

(b)    aninvention results from inventive activity if it does not obviously follow from the state of the art, either as to the method, the application, the combination of methods, or the product which it concerns, or as to the industrial result it produces; and

(c)    aninvention is capable of industrial application if it can be manufactured or used in      any kind of industry, including agriculture.

(3)    Insubsection (2) of this section, "the art" means the art or field of knowledge to which an invention relates and "the state of the art" means everything concerning that art or field of knowledge which has been made available to the public anywhere and at any time whatever (by means of a written or oral description, by use or in any other way) before the date of the filing of the patent application relating to the invention or the foreign priority date validly claimed in respect thereof, so however that an invention shall not be deemed to have been made available to the public merely by reason of the fact that, within the period of six months preceding the filing of a patent application in respect of the invention, the inventor or his successor in title has exhibited it in an official or officially recognised international exhibition.

(4)    Patentscannot be validly obtained in respect of-

(a)    plantor animal varieties, or essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals (other than microbiological processes and their products); or

(b)    inventionsthe publication or exploitation of which would be contrary to public order or morality (it being understood for the purposes of this paragraph that the exploitation of an invention is not contrary to public order or morality merely because its exploitation is prohibited by law).

(5)    Principlesand discoveries of a scientific nature are not inventions for the purposes of this Act.

2.     (1)    Subject to this section, the right to a patent in respect of an invention is vested in the statutory inventor, that is to say, the person who, whether or not he is the true inventor, is the first to file, or validly to claim a foreign priority for, a patent application in respect of the invention.

(2)    Thetrue inventor is entitled to be named as such in the patent, whether or not he is also the statutory inventor, and, the entitlement in question shall not be modifiable by      contract.

(3)    If the essential elements of a patent application have been obtained by the purported applicant from the invention of another person (or from that other person's successor in title) without the consent of that other person (or his said successor) both to the obtaining of those essential elements and to the filing of the application, all rights in the application and in any patent granted in pursuance of it shall be deemed to be transferred to that other person or his said successor, as the case may be.

(4)    Wherean invention is made in the course of employment or in the execution of a      contract for the performance of specified work, the right to a patent in the invention is   vested in the employer or, as the case may be, in the person who commissioned the work:

Provided that, where the inventor is an employee, then-

(a)    if-

(i)     hiscontract of employment does not require him to exercise any inventive activity but         he has in making the invention used data or means that his employment has put at his    disposal, or

(ii)    the invention is of exceptional importance, he is entitled to fair remuneration taking into account his salary and the importance of the invention; and

(b)    theentitlement in question is not modifiable by contract and may be enforced by civil proceedings.

Compulsory Licences

1.     Subject to this Part, at any time after the expiration of a period of four years after the filing of a patent application or three years after the grant of a patent, whichever period last expires, a person may apply to the Court for the grant of a compulsory licence on one or more of the following grounds-

(a)    thatthe patented invention, being capable of being worked in Nigeria, has not been so worked;

(b)    thatthe existing degree of working, of the patented invention in Nigeria does not    meet on reasonable terms the demand for the product;

(c)    thatthe working of the patented invention in Nigeria is being hindered or prevented by the importation of the patented article; and

(d)    that,by reason of the refusal of the patentee to grant licences on reasonable terms, the establishment or development of industrial or commercial activities in Nigeria is unfairly and substantially prejudiced.

2      If an invention protected by a patent in Nigeria cannot be worked without infringing rights derived from a patent granted on an earlier application or benefiting from an       earlier foreign priority, a compulsory licence may be granted to the patentee of the       later patent to the extent necessary for the working of his invention if the invention-

(a)    Serves industrial purposes different from those served by the it, invention which is the subject of the earlier patent; or

(b)    constitutes substantial technical progress in relation to that last mentioned invention.

3.     If the two inventions mentioned in paragraph 2 of this Schedule serve the same         industrial purposes, a compulsory licence may be granted under that paragraph only on condition that a compulsory licence shall also be granted in respect of the later patent to the patentee of the earlier patent, if he so requests.

4.     A compulsory licence shall not be granted in respect of a patent if the patentee         satisfies the court that his actions in relation to the patented invention are justifiable in        the circumstances, but he shall not be held to have so satisfied the court if he merely        shows that the patented article is freely available for importation.

5.     A compulsory licence shall not be granted unless the applicant-

(a)    satisfies the court that he has asked the patentee for a contractual licence but has been    unable to obtain such a license on reasonable terms and within a reasonable time; and

(b)    offers guarantees satisfactory to the court to work the relevant invention sufficiently to remedy the deficiencies (or to satisfy the requirements) which gave rise to his   application.

6.     A compulsory license-  (a)   entitles the licensee to do any act mentioned in section 6 of this Act except         importation;

(b)   does not entitle the licensee to grant further licences;

(c)   Shall be non-exclusive, and

(d)   may contain additional obligations and restrictions as regards both the licensee and   the patentee.

7.     A compulsory licence may be transferred only with the industrial undertaking in         which the relevant invention is used, and no such transfer shall be valid until the         consent of the court has been obtained.

8.     On hearing an application for a compulsory licence, the court shall first decide         whether a compulsory licence may be granted and shall then, if it decides in favour of    the grant and the parties cannot agree on the terms, proceed to fix the terms (including adequate royalties having regard extent to which the relevant invention is to be         worked which shall be deemed to constitute a valid contract between the parties.

9.     On the application of the patentee, the court may cancel a compulsory licence if-

(a)    the licensee fails to comply with the terms of the licence; or

(b)    the conditions which justified the grant of the licence have ceased to exist, so         however that in the latter case a reasonable time shall be given to the licensee to cease     working the relevant invention if an immediate cessation would cause him to suffer     substantial damage.

10.   On the application of the patentee or licensee, the court may vary the terms of a      compulsory licence if new facts justify the variation, and in particular (without         prejudice to the generality of the foregoing) if the patentee has granted contractual         licences on more favourable terms.

11.   Where the court grants, cancels or varies the terms of a compulsory licence-

(a)    the proper officer of the court shall inform the Registrar, who shall register the grant,        cancellation or variation without fee; and

(b)    the grant, cancellation or variation shall have no effect as against third parties until it        has been registered.

12.   A representative of the Minister shall have the right to appear and be heard at the    hearingof an application for a compulsory licence.

13.   The Minister by order in the Federal Gazette may provide that, for certain patented    productsand processes (or for certain categories thereof) declared by the order to be         of vital importance for the defence or the economy of Nigeria or for public        health, compulsory licences may be granted before the expiration of the period        mentioned in      paragraph 1 above and may permit importation.

14.   For the purposes of this Part, references to the working of a patented invention are to        be construed as references to-

(a)   the manufacture of a patented article; or

(b)    the application of a patented process; or

(c)   the use in manufacture of a patented machine, by an effective and serious         establishment existing in Nigeria on a scale which is adequate and reasonable in the    circumstances.

19.   The revisions of any licence, assignment or agreement made before or after the         commencement of this Act between a patentee and any person, other than the         Government, or a Ministry shall be of no effect in so far as those provisions restrict or   regulate the use of a patented article or invention or provide for the making of payment in respect of any such use, or are calculated by reference thereto.
