[20th day of April 1979]                        [Commencement]

### Part I: Proceedings from act of bankruptcy to discharge

Acts of Bankruptcy

1.     A debtor commits an act of bankruptcy in each of the following cases-

(a)            if a creditor -

(i)             has obtained a final judgment or final order against him for any amount, and execution thereon not having been stayed, has a bankruptcy notice served on him, and

(ii)     does not, within fourteen days after service of the notice, comply with the requirements of the notice or satisfy the court that he has a counter-claim, set off or cross demand which equals or exceeds the amount of the judgment debt or sum ordered to be paid, and which he could not set up in the action in which the judgment was obtained or the proceedings in which the order was obtained,

and for the purposes of this paragraph and of section 4. any person who is for the time being entitled to enforce a final judgment or final order shall be deemed to be a creditor who has obtained a final judgment or final order;

(b)            if execution against him has been levied by seizure of his goods under process in an action, or proceedings in the court, and the goods have either been sold or held by the bailiff for twenty-one days:

Provided that, where an inter-pleader summons has been taken out in regard to the goods seized, the time elapsing between the date at which such summons is taken out and the date at which the proceedings on such summons are finally disposed of, settled or abandoned shall not be taken into account in calculating such period of twenty-one

days;

(c)     if he files in the court a declaration of his inability to pay his debts or presents a bankruptcy petition against himself.

(d)            if he suspends or gives notice that he is about to suspend payment of his debts to any of his creditors; or

(e)    if under a credit agreement the creditor becomes entitled to file a bankruptcy petition; or

(f)     if, in Nigeria or elsewhere, he makes a conveyance or assignment of his property to a trustee or trustees for the benefit of his creditor generally; or

(g)            if, in Nigeria or elsewhere, he makes a fraudulent conveyance gift, delivery or transfer of his property or any part thereof, with an intent to defeat or delay the claim of his creditors; or

(h)     if, in Nigeria or elsewhere, he makes any conveyance or transfer of his property or any part thereof; or created any charge thereon, which would under this or any other Act be void as a fraudulent preference if he were adjudged bankrupt; or

(i)             if, with intent to defeat or delay the claims of his creditors, he departs out of Nigeria, or being out of Nigeria remains out of Nigeria, or departs from his dwelling, or otherwise absents himself, or begins to keep house.

2.     A bankruptcy notice under this Act shall be issued to a judgment creditor, or creditor who has obtained a final order, by the Registrar on the filing of a request for that purpose, and shall be in such form as may be prescribed by the general rules, and shall require the debtor to pay the judgment debt or sum ordered to be paid in accordance with the terms of the judgment or order, or to secure or compound for it to the satisfaction of the creditor or the court, and shall state the consequences of non-compliance with the notice, and shall be served in the prescribed manner:

Provided that a bankruptcy notice-

(a)            may specify an agent to act on behalf of the creditor in respect of any payment or other thing required by the notice to be made to, or done to the satisfaction of, the creditor;

(b)            shall not be invalidated by reason only that the sum specified in the notice as the amount due exceeds the amount actually due, unless the debtor within the time allowed for payment gives notice to the creditor that he disputes the validity of the notice on the ground of such mis-statement; but if the debtor does not give such notice, he shall be deemed to have complied with the bankruptcy notice if within the time allowed he takes such steps as would have constituted a compliance with the notice had the actual amount due been correctly specified therein.

3.     Subject to the conditions hereinafter specified, if a debtor commits an act of bankruptcy the court may, on a bankruptcy petition being presented either by a creditor or by the debtor, make an order, in this Act called a receiving order, for the protection of the estate.

4.     (1)     Subject to the provisions of section 7, a creditor shall not be entitled to present a   bankruptcy petition against a debtor unless -

(a)            the debt owing by the debtor to the petitioning creditor, or if two or more creditors join in the petition, the aggregate amount of debts owing to the several petitioning creditors, is not less than N2,000;

(b)            the debt is a liquidated sum, payable either immediately or at some certain future time;

(c)     the act of bankruptcy on which the petition is grounded has occurred within three months before the presentation of the petition; and

(d)     the debtor is ordinarily resident in Nigeria, or within a year before the date of the presentation of the petition, has ordinarily resided or had a dwelling-house or place of business in Nigeria, or has carried on business in Nigeria, personally or by means of an agent or manager, or is or within the said period has been a member of a firm or partnership of persons which has carried on business in Nigeria by means of a partner or partners or an agent or manager.

(2)            If the petitioning creditor is a secured creditor he shall in his petition either state that he is willing to give up his security for the benefit of the creditors in the event of the debtor being adjudged bankrupt, or give an estimate of the value of his security; in the latter case he may be admitted as a petitioning creditor to the extent of the balance of the debt due to him after deducting the value so estimated in the same manner as if he were an unsecured creditor.

(3)    Notwithstandingthe provisions of any other law or enactment and without prejudice to any other rights of the debtor, a creditor who is entitled to present a bankruptcy petition on or before the end of December, 1992 shall not be disentitled from presenting a petition by virtue only of the provisions of section 4(1) (c) of this Act if the petition is presented before the expiration of a period of six months.

5.     The following provisions shall have effect in the case of a firm carrying on business in Nigeria -

(a)            a creditor of the firm shall be entitled to present a bankruptcy petition against the firm, and a receiving order may be made against the firm in respect of an act of bankruptcy committed in reference to the business of the firm by any partner of the firm or by any person having control or management of the business of the firm. An act of bankruptcy shall be deemed to be committed in reference to the business of the firm in all cases in which the act relates to the property or creditors of the firm and would be an act of bankruptcy by such partner or person as aforesaid if it related to his property or creditors;

(b)            it shall be sufficient that a receiving order against the firm be made in the firm's name, without mentioning the names of the partners, and such receiving order shall affect the joint and separate property of all the partners;

(c)     the right of a creditor to present a bankruptcy petition against the firm, and the jurisdiction of the court to make a receiving order or an adjudication of bankruptcy against the firm, shall not be affected by the fact, if it is so, that all or any of the partners of the firm are not citizens of Nigeria or are not resident in Nigeria.

6.(1)  Immediately on the filing of any petition the Official Receiver may in cases where he has reason to believe that any offence under this Act or any fraud has been or is about to be perpetrated, by notice delivered to the debtor in person or by ordinary post, summon the debtor to attend before him to give such information as he requires, and may, either by himself or his agent authorised by him in writing, enter on any premises occupied by the debtor between the hours of 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. for the purpose of inspecting his property, stock in trade and books of account.

(2)            It shall be the duty of the debtor to furnish the Official Receiver with all such information as it is in the debtor's power to give or to obtain.

(3)            If the debtor -

(a)            fails without reasonable cause to attend to the Official Receiver as aforesaid or to furnish him with such information as aforesaid; or

(b)            obstructs the search of the premises or the production of any book or document required in connection therewith; or

(c)    authorizes or permits any obstruction,

the debtor shall be liable on summary conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months.

(4)            Every person who takes any part in any obstruction mentioned in subsection (3)(b) and (c) of this section, whether authorised or permitted by the debtor or not, shall be liable to the like penalty.

7.(1)    Acreditor's petition shall -

(a)     be verified by affidavit of the creditor or of some person on his behalf, having knowledge of the facts; and

(b)     be served in the same manner as a writ of summons unless some other manner of service be prescribed.

(2)     At the hearing, the court shall require proof of

(a)     the debt of the petitioning creditor;

(b)     the service of the petition; and

(c)     the act of bankruptcy, or if more than one act of bankruptcy is alleged, acts of bankruptcy,

and if satisfied with the proof, may make a receiving order in pursuance of the petition.

(3)     If the court is not satisfied with the proof of the petitioning creditor's debt or of the act of bankruptcy or of the service of the petition, or is satisfied by the debtor that he is able to pay his debts, or is not satisfied that the assets for division among the unsecured creditors, after payment of all costs, charges and expenses, and the debts which are preferential under this Act shall be sufficient to pay a dividend of fifteen per cent, or considers that for other sufficient cause no order ought to be made, the court may dismiss the petition.

(4)     When the act of bankruptcy relied on is non-compliance with a bankruptcy notice to pay, secure or compound for a judgment debt or sum ordered to be paid, the court may, if it thinks fit, stay or dismiss the petition on the ground that an appeal is pending from the judgment or order.

(5)    Where the debtor appears on the petition and denies that he is indebted to the petitioner, or that he is indebted to such an amount as would justify the petitioner in presenting a petition against him, the court, on such security (if any) being given as the court may require for payment to the petitioner of any debt which may be established against him in due course of law, and of the costs of establishing the debt, may, instead of dismissing the petition, stay all proceedings on the petition for such time as may be required for trial of the question relating to the debt.

(6)     Where proceedings are stayed the court may, if by reason of the delay caused by the stay of proceedings or for any other cause it thinks just, make a receiving order on the petition of some other creditor, and shall thereupon dismiss, on such terms as it thinks just, the petition in which proceedings have been stayed as aforesaid.

(7)     A creditor's petition shall not after presentment be withdrawn without the leave of the court.

8.(1)  A debtor's petition shall allege that the debtor is unable to pay his debts, and the presentation thereof shall be deemed an act of bankruptcy without the previous filing by the debtor of any declaration of inability to pay his debts, and the court shall thereupon make a receiving order:

Provided that it shall be lawful for the court in its discretion to refuse the order if it is not satisfied that the assets for division among the unsecured creditors after payment of all costs, charges and expenses, and the debts which are preferential under this Act, will be sufficient to pay a dividend of fifteen per cent, or if the court considers for other sufficient cause that no order ought to be made.

(2)     In subsection (1) of this section "sufficient cause" includes the non-attendance of the debtor, or in the case of a firm, of at least one of the partners thereof, on the hearing of the petition, the absence of any material book of account, or any fraud or misconduct not amounting to fraud by the debtor in relation to his affairs, or in the case of a firm or person carrying on business under a foreign firm name, the non-production of the partnership book or of the receipt used in connection with the business.

(3)    A debtor's petition shall not after presentment be withdrawn without the leave of the court.

9.     On the hearing of any creditor's or debtor's petition it shall be lawful for the Official Receiver to appear and to call, examine and cross-examine any witness and, if he so thinks fit, to support or oppose the making of a receiving order.

10.    (1)   On the making of a receiving order the Official Receiver shall be thereby constituted receiver of the property of the debtor, and thereafter, except as directed by this Act, no creditor to whom the debtor is indebted in respect of any debt provable in bankruptcy shall have any remedy against the property or person of the debtor in respect of the debt, or shall commence any action or other legal proceedings, unless with the leave of the court and on such terms as the court may impose.

(2)    This section shall not affect the power of any secured creditor to realize or otherwise                           deal with his security.

11.    The court may, if it is shown to be necessary for the protection of the estate, at any time after the presentation of a bankruptcy petition and before a receiving order is made, appoint the Official Receiver to be interim receiver of the property of the debtor or of any part thereof, and direct him to take immediate possession thereof or of any part thereof.

12.   (1) The court may at any time after the presentation of a bankruptcy petition either stay any action, execution or other legal process against the property or person of the debtor or allow it to continue on such terms as it may think just.

(2)    Where the court makes an order staying any action or proceeding, or staying proceedings generally, the order may be served by sending a copy thereof, under the seal of the court, by post to the address for service of the plaintiff and any other party to the proceedings or to the address of the legal practitioner of such party.

(3)    Without prejudice to the provisions of subsection (1) of this section if the court orders the release of any debtor who is under execution for a civil debt, it may impose such conditions as it thinks fit, and in particular it may require as a condition of such release that the debtor finds security to attend in the subsequent bankruptcy proceedings and to abide by all orders of the court relating to the said proceedings.

13.   (1) The court may, on the application of the Official Receiver or of any creditor or creditors, and if satisfied that special the nature of the debtor's estate or business or the interests manager. of the creditors generally require the appointment of a special manager of the estate or business other than the Official Receiver, appoint a manager thereof accordingly to act until a trustee is appointed, and with such powers (including any of the powers of a receiver) as may be entrusted to him by the Official Receiver.

(2)            The special manager shall give security and account in such manner as the court may direct.

(2)            In such case the Official Receiver shall hold a meeting of creditors before the pubic examination of the debtor is concluded, and send to each creditor before the meeting a copy of the debtor's proposal with a report thereon; and if at the meeting a majority in number and not less than two thirds in value of all the creditors who have proved resolve to accept the proposal, it shall be deemed to be duly accepted by the creditors, and when approved by the court shall be binding on all the creditors.

(3)           The debtor may at the meeting amend the terms of his proposal, if the amendment is in the opinion of the Official Receiver calculated to benefit the general body of creditors.

(4)            Any creditor who has proved his debt may assent to or dissent from the proposal by a letter addressed to the Official Receiver so as to be received by him not later than three days preceding the meeting, and any such assent or dissent shall have effect as if the creditor had been present and had voted at the meeting.

(8)    The court shall before approving the proposal hear a report of the Official Receiver as to the terms thereof and as to the conduct of the debtor, and any objections which may be made by or on behalf of any creditor.

(9)    If the court is of opinion that the terms of the proposal are not reasonable or are not calculated to benefit the general body of creditors, the court shall refuse to approve the proposal.

(10)  If any facts are proved on proof of which the court would be required either to refuse, suspend or attach conditions to the debtor's discharge where he is adjudged bankrupt, the court shall refuse to approve the proposal unless it provides reasonable security for the payment of not less than twenty-five per cent on all the unsecured debts provable against the debtor's estate.

(11)          In any other case the court may either approve or refuse to approve the proposal.

(12)   If the court approves the proposal, the approval may be testified by the seal of the court being attached to the instrument containing the terms of the proposed composition or scheme, or by the terms being embodied in an order of the court.

(13)   A composition or scheme accepted and approved in pursuance of this section shall be binding on all the creditors so far as it relates to any debts due to them from the debtor and provable in bankruptcy.

(14)   A certificate of the Official Receiver that a composition or scheme has been duly accepted and approved shall, in the absence of fraud, be conclusive as to its validity.

(15)   The provisions of a composition or scheme under this section may be enforced by the court on application by any person interested, and any disobedience of an order of the court made on the application shall be deemed a contempt of court.

(16)  If default is made in payment of any instalment due in pursuance of the composition or scheme, or if it appears to the court on satisfactory evidence that the composition or scheme cannot, in consequence of legal difficulties or for any sufficient cause, proceed without injustice or under delay to the creditors or to the debtor, or that the approval of the court was obtained by fraud, the court may, if it thinks fit, on application by the Official Receiver or the trustee or by any creditor, adjudge the debtor bankrupt and annul the composition or scheme, but without prejudice to the validity of any sale, disposition or payment duly made or thing duly done under or in pursuance of the composition or scheme.

(17)   Where a debtor is adjudged bankrupt under subsection (16) of this section, any debt provable in other respects, which has been contracted before the adjudication, shall be provable in the bankruptcy.

(18)  If under or in pursuance of a composition or scheme a trustee is appointed to administer the debtor's property or manage his business or to distribute the composition, section 27 and Part IV of this Act shall apply as if the trustee were a trustee in bankruptcy and as if the terms "bankruptcy", "bankrupt" and "order of adjudication" included respectively a composition or scheme of arrangement, a compounding or arranging debtor and an order approving the composition or scheme.

(19)  Part II of this Act shall, so far as the nature of the case and the terms of the composition or scheme admit, apply thereto; the same interpretation being given to the words "trustee", "bankruptcy", "bankrupt" and "order of adjudication" as in subsection 18 of this section.

(20)   No composition or scheme shall be approved by the court which does not provide for the payment in priority to other debts of all debts directed to be so paid in the distribution of the property of a bankrupt.

(21)   The acceptance by a creditor of a composition or scheme shall not release any person who under this Act would not be released by an order of discharge if the debtor had been adjudged bankrupt.

19.    Notwithstanding the acceptance and approval of a composition or scheme, the composition or scheme shall not be binding on any creditor so far as regards a debt or liability from which under the provisions of this Act the debtor would not be released by an order of discharge in bankruptcy, unless the creditor assents to the composition or scheme.

20.   (1)    Where a receiving order is made against a debtor then, if the creditors at the first meeting or any adjournment thereof by ordinary resolution resolve that the debtor be adjudged bankrupt, or pass no resolution, or if the creditors do not meet or if a composition or scheme is not approved in pursuance of this Act within fourteen days after the conclusion of the examination of the debtor or such further time as the court may allow, the court shall adjudge the debtor bankrupt: and thereupon the property of the bankrupt shall become divisible among his creditors and shall vest in a trustee.

(2)    Notice of every order adjudging a debtor bankrupt, stating the name, address and description of the bankrupt, the date of the adjudication and the name of the trustee, shall be published in the Federal Gazette and shall be advertised in at least two newspapers, or as may be prescribed, and the date of the order shall, for the purposes of this Act, be the date of the adjudication.

(2)    The person appointed shall, unless he is the Official Receiver, give such security as the court may direct or as may be prescribed, and the court, if satisfied with the security, shall certify under the hand of the Registrar that his appointment has been duly made, unless the appointment is disapproved by the court on the ground that it has not been made in good faith by a majority in value of the creditors voting, or that the person appointed is not fit to act as trustee, or that his connection with or relation to the bankrupt or his estate or any particular creditor makes it difficult for him to act with impartiality in the interests of the creditors generally.

(3)    The appointment of a trustee shall take effect as from the date of the certificate.

(4)    When a debtor is adjudged bankrupt after the first meeting of creditors has been held and a trustee has not been appointed prior to the adjudication, the Official Receiver shall forthwith summon a meeting of creditors for the purpose of appointing a trustee; and if no trustee is then appointed by the creditors the court shall on the application of the Official Receiver appoint the Official Receiver or some other fit person to be trustee.

22.   (1)    The creditors qualified to vote may, at their first or any subsequent meeting by resolution appoint a committee of inspection for the purpose of superintending the administration of the bankrupt's property by the trustee.

(2)            The committee of inspection shall consist of not more than five nor less than three persons, possessing one or other of the following qualifications, that is-

(a)            that of being a creditor or the holder of a general proxy or general power of attorney from a creditor, provided that no creditor and no holder of a general proxy or general power of attorney from a creditor shall be qualified to act as a member of the committee of inspection until the creditor has proved his debt and the proof has been admitted; or

(b)            that of being a person to whom a creditor intends to give a general proxy or general power of attorney, provided that no such person shall be qualified to act as a member of the committee of inspection until he holds such a proxy or power of attorney, and until the creditor has proved his debt and the proof has been admitted.

(3)            The committee of inspection shall meet at such times as it shall from time to time appoint and failing such appointment, at least once a month, and the trustee or any member of the committee may also call a meeting of the committee as and when he thinks necessary.

(4)    The committee may act by a majority of its members present at a meeting, but shall not act unless a majority of the committee is present at the meeting.

(5)    Any member of the committee may resign his office by notice in writing signed by him and delivered to the trustee.

(6)            If a member of the committee becomes bankrupt, or compound or arranges with his creditors, or is absent from five consecutive meetings of the committee, his office shall thereupon become vacant.

(7)    Any member of the committee may be removed by an ordinary resolution at any meeting of creditors of which seven days' notice has been given stating the object of the meeting.

(8)            On a vacancy occurring in the office of a member of the committee, the trustee shall forthwith summon a meeting of creditors for the purpose of filling the vacancy, and the meeting may, by resolution, appoint another creditor or other person eligible as above to fill the vacancy.

(9)    The continuing members of the committee, provided there be not less than three such continuing members, may act notwithstanding any vacancy therein and, where the number of members of the committee of inspection is for the time being less than five, the creditors may increase that number so that it does not exceed five.

(10)  If there be no committee of inspection any act or thing or any direction or permission by this Act authorised or required to be done or given by the committee may be done or given by the court on the application of the trustee.

23.   (1)    Where a debtor is adjudged bankrupt the creditors may, if they think fit, at any time after the adjudication, by a majority in number and not less than two-thirds in value of all the creditors who have proved, resolve to accept a proposal for a composition in satisfaction of the debts due to them under the bankruptcy or for a scheme of arrangement of the bankrupt's affairs, and thereupon the same proceedings shall be taken and the same consequences shall ensue as in the case of a composition or scheme accepted before adjudication.

(2)    If the court approves the composition or scheme it may make an order annulling the bankruptcy and vesting the property of the bankrupt in him or in such other person as the court may appoint on such terms and subject to such conditions, if any, as the court may declare.

(3)    If default is made in payment of any instalment due in pursuance of the composition or scheme, or if it appears to the court that the composition or scheme cannot proceed without injustice or undue delay, or that the approval of the court was obtained by fraud, the court may, if it thinks fit, on application by any person interested, adjudge the debtor bankrupt and annul the composition or scheme, but without prejudice to the validity of any sale, disposition or payment duly made or thing duly done under or in pursuance of the composition or scheme.

(4)            Where a debtor is adjudged bankrupt under subsection (3) of this section, all debts, provable in other respects, which have been contracted before the date of such adjudication shall be provable in the bankruptcy.

(6)    If in the opinion of the court the value of the debt or liability is incapable of being fairly estimated, the court may make an order to that effect, and thereupon the debt or liability shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed to be a debt not provable in bankruptcy.
