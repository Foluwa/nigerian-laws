(2)      This Act shall apply to every separate country within the Commonwealth.

(3)      For the purposes of this Act, each of the following areas shall be treated as a separate country, that is to say-

(a)      each sovereign and independent country within the Commonwealth together with any dependent territories which that country designates; and

(b)      each country within the Commonwealth which though not sovereign and independent, is not designated for the purposes of paragraph (a) of this subsection.

(4)      An order under subsection (3) (a) of this section designating a dependent country as forming part of a sovereign and independent country shall be made if, but only if, the dependent country has signified to the Government of the Federation that it desires that its territory be designated as part of the independent country, for the purposes of this Act.

(5)      If it appears to the President that the law of a country to which this Act applies by virtue of subsection (3) of this section contains provisions substantially equivalent to the provisions of this Act, the President may by order published in the Gazette direct that this Act shall apply in relation to that country with such modifications (whether by way of addition, alteration or omission) as may be specified in the order, and where an order under this section is in force in relation to a country, this Act shall have effect in relation to that country with the modification specified in the order.

(6)      Every order made under subsection (5) of this section applying this Act to a country shall include a provision inserting in the Schedule to this Act an entry consisting of the name of that country and the year and number of the statutory instrument containing the order and where any such order is varied or revoked, the varying or revoking order shall include a provision deleting the relevant entry in that Schedule, as the case may require.

2.        Objectsof the Act

(1)      The purpose of this Act is-

(a)      to increase the level and scope of assistance rendered between Commonwealth governments in criminal matters;

(b)      to augment, but in no way to derogate from, similar existing forms of formal and informal co-operation between Commonwealth countries; and

(c)       to encourage the development of enhanced co-operation arrangements in other fora.

(2)      This Act makes provision for the giving of assistance by the competent authorities of one country (in this Act referred to as "the requested country") in respect of criminal matters arising in another country (in this Act referred to as "the requesting country").

(3)      Assistance which may be exchanged between Nigeria and any other Common wealth country under this Act include the following, that is to say-

(a)      identifying and locating criminal offenders;

(b)      the service of relevant documents;

(c)       examination of witnesses;

(d)      search and seizure of assets;

(e)      obtaining evidence;

(f)       facilitating the personal appearance of witnesses before an administrative panel, a court, a tribunal or such similar proceedings;

(i)       tracing, seizing and forfeiting the proceeds of criminal activities.

(2)      Accordingly-

(a)      all requests from Nigeria to any other country in the Commonwealth; and

(b)      all requests to Nigeria from any other Commonwealth country, concerning any assistance to which section 2 (3) of this Act relates, shall be channelled through the person or authority designated for the purposes of this Act.

4.        Actionin the requesting country

(1)      A request for any assistance specified under section 2 (3) of this Act may be commenced by any law enforcement agency, public prosecution or judicial authority competent to do so under the law of the requesting country.

(2)      The designated Central Authority of the requesting country, if he is satisfied that the request can properly be made under this Act, shall transmit the request to the Central Authority of the requested country and shall ensure that the request contains all the supporting information required under the provisions of this Act.

(3)      The designated Central Authority of the requesting country shall as far as practicable, provide such additional information as the Central Authority of the requested country may seek.

5.        Actionin the requested country

(1)      Subject to this section, where Nigeria is the requested country, the Central Authority shall, in an appropriate case, grant the assistance requested as expeditiously as practicable; and for that purpose, the Central Authority of Nigeria shall ensure that all competent authorities in Nigeria comply with the request.

(2)      If the Central Authority in Nigeria considers that-

(a)      the request does not comply with the provisions of this Act;

(b)      in accordance with the provisions of this Act, the assistance ought to be refused either in whole or in part; or

(c)       there are circumstances which are likely to cause a significant delay in complying with the request, then the Central Authority of Nigeria shall promptly so inform the Central Authority of the requesting country, adducing reasons.

6.        Refusalof assistance

(1)      The Central Authority for Nigeria after consultation with the President, may ref- use to comply in part or in whole with a request for assistance under this Act if the criminal matter in respect of which assistance is sought appears to the Central Authority in Nigeria to concern-

(b)      an offence or proceedings of a political character;

(c)       conduct which in the requesting country is an offence only under military law or relating to military obligations;

(d)      conduct in relation to which the person now accused or suspected of having committed an offence had previously been acquitted or convicted by a court in Nigeria.

(2)      The Central Authority for Nigeria after consultation with the President may refuse to comply in whole or in part with a request for assistance under this Act-

(a)      to the extent that it appears to the Central Authority aforesaid that compliance would be contrary to the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 or would be prejudicial to the security, international relations or other essential public interests of Nigeria; or

(b)      where there are substantial grounds leading the Central Authority to believe that compliance would facilitate the prosecution or punishment of any person on account of his race, religion, nationality or political opinions or would cause prejudice on account of any of the reasons aforesaid, to the person affected by the request.

(3)      The Central Authority for Nigeria may after consultation with the President, ref- use to comply in whole or, in part with a request for assistance to the extent that the steps required to be taken in order to comply with the request cannot lawfully be taken under any law in force in Nigeria in respect of criminal matters arising in Nigeria.

(4)      An offence shall not be regarded as an offence of a political character for the purpose of subsection (1) (b) of this section, if it is an offence within the scope of any international convention to which both Nigeria and the requesting or requested country, as the case may be, are parties and which imposes on the parties thereto an obligation either to extradite or prosecute a person accused of the commission of the offence.

(5)      The provisions of sections 4, 5 and 6 of this Act shall apply mutatis mutandis to any case in which Nigeria is either the requesting or requested country, as the case may require.
