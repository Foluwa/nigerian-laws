(b)       the inspection or testing, as the case may be, of ordnance and materiel;

(c)       such other duties as may be prescribed under this Act.

(3)       The provisions of the Schedule to this Act shall have effect as regards the membership, proceedings and contractual powers of the Corporation.

2.        Corporation to act under directions of Minister

(1)       The Minister may for all or any of the purposes of this Act initiate or approve policy; and accordingly the Minister may give to the Corporation directions of a general or special nature as to-

(a)       the manner in which the Corporation is to exercise its powers; or

(b)       the payment of allowances to members of the Corporation,

and it shall be the duty of the Corporation to give effect to any such directions.

(2)       No policy initiated by the Corporation shall be implemented without prior reference to an approval by the Minister, and the Minister may, if he thinks it necessary, consult with the Corporation before approving any policy, but the question whether there was any such consultation or what was decided shall not be inquired into by any court.

3.           Appointment and powers of Director-General

(1)       The Minister may from time to time appoint a military officer of the rank of Brigadier or above to be Director-General of the Corporation.

(3)       The Director-General shall co-ordinate, harmonise and supervise the general planning of defence and allied industries which are set up to produce specifically or mainly for the armed forces in addition to encouraging other industries within the economy to produce for the general consumer as well as for the armed forces.

(5)       The fact that any such powers have been delegated to the Director-General shall not preclude the Corporation itself from exercising them in any special case.

(6)       The powers mentioned in this section are-

(a)       the executive control over other servants of the Corporation;

(b)       the supervision of accounts and records;

(c)       the preparation for approval of sectional programmes and plans necessary to carry into effect approved policy or any directions of the Corporation.
