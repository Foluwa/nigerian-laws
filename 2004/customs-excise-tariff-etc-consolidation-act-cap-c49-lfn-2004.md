(2) a.           Any reference in a heading to an article shall be taken to include a reference to that article incomplete or unfinished, provided that, as presented, the incomplete or unfinished article has the essential character of the complete or finished article.

It shall also be taken to include a reference to that article complete or finished (or failing to be classified as complete or finished by virtue of this rule), presented, unassembled or disassembled.

b.       Any reference in a heading to a material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to mixtures or combinations of that material or substance with other materials or substance. Any reference to goods of a given material or substance shall be taken to include a reference to goods consisting wholly or partly of such material or substance. The classification of goods consisting of more than one material or substance shall be according to the principles of rule 3.

(3)     When by application of rule 2 (b) or for any other reason, goods are, prima facie classifiable under two or more headings, classification shall be effected as follows - a. the heading, which provides the most specific description, shall be referred to heading providing a more general description. However when two or more headings each refer to part only of the materials or substances contained in mixed or composite goods or to part only of the items in a set put up for retail sale, these headings are to be regarded as equally specific in relation to those goods, even if one of them gives a more complete or precise description of the goods

b.       mixtures, composite goods consisting of different materials or made up of different components, and goods put up in sets for retail sale, which cannot be classified by reference to 3 (a), shall be classified as if they consisted of the material or component which gives them their essential character, in so far as this criterion is applicable.

c.       when goods cannot be classified by reference to 3 (a) or 3 (b), they shall be classified under the heading, which occur last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration.

(4)     Goods, which cannot be classified in accordance with the above rules, shall be classified under the heading appropriate to the goods to which they are most akin.

(5)     In addition to the foregoing provisions, the following rules shall apply in respect of the goods referred to therein.-

a.       camera cases, musical instrument cases, gun cases, drawing instrument cases, necklace cases and similar containers, specifically shaped or fitted to contain a specific article or set of articles, suitable for long-term use and presented with the articles for which they are intended, shall be classified with such articles when of a kind normally soled therewith. This rule does not, however, apply to containers which gives the whole its essential character.

b.       Subject to the provisions of rule 5 (a) above, packaging materials and packing containers presented with the goods therein, shall be classified with the goods if they are of a kind normally used for packing such goods. However, this provision does not apply when such packing materials or packing containers are clearly suitable for repetitive use.

(6).    For legal purposes, the classification of goods in the sub-headings of a heading shall be determined according to the terms of those sub-headings and any related subheading notes and, mutates mutandis, to the above rules, on the understanding that only sub-headings at the same level are comparable.

3. -    Goods which could be included in two or more of the headings of this chapter are to be classified in that one of those headings which occurs last in numerical order.

4. -    In headings 29.04 to 29.06, 29.08 to 29.11 and 29.13 to 29.20, any reference to halogenated, sulphonated, nitrated or nitrosated derivatives includes a reference to compound derivaties, such as sulphohalogenated, nitrohalogenated, nitrosulphonated or nitrosulphohalogenated derivatives.

Nitro or nitroso groups are not to be taken as “nitrogen-functions” for the purposes of heading 29.29.

For the purposes of headings 29.11, 29.12, 29.14, 29.18 and 29.22, “oxygen-function” is to be restricted to the functions (the characteristic organic oxygen-containing groups) referred to in headings 29.05 to 29.20.

5. - (a)The esters of acid-function organic compounds of sub-Chapters I to VII with organic compounds of these sub-Chapters are to be classified with that compound is classified in the heading which occurs last in numerical order in these sub- Chapters.

(b)     Esters of ethyl alcohol with acid-function organic compounds or sub-Chapter 1 to VII are to be classified in the same heading as the corresponding acid-function compounds.

(c)     Subject to Note 1 to Section VI and Note 2 to Chapter 28:

(1)     Inorganic salts of organic compounds such as acid-phenol- or enolfunction compounds or organic bases, of sub-Chapters 1 to X or heading 29.42, are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the organic compound; and

(2)     Salts formed between organic compounds of subchapters 1 to X heading 29.42 are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the base or to the acid (including phenol- or enol-function compounds) from which they are formed, whichever occurs last in numerical order in the Chapter.

(d)     Metal alcoholates are to be classifed in the same heading as the corresponding alcohols except in the case of ethanol (heading 29.05).

(e)     Halides of carboxylic acids are to be classified in the same heading as the corresponding acids.

6.-     The compounds of headings 29.30 and 29.31 are organic compound the molecules of which contain, in addition to atoms of hydrogen, oxygen or nitrogen, atoms of other nonmetals or of metals (such as sulphur, arsenic, mercury or lead) directly linked to carbon atoms. Heading 29.30 (organo-sulphur compounds) and heading No.

29.31(other organoinorganic compounds) do not include sulphonated or halogenated derivatives (including compound derivatives) which, apart from hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, only have directly linked to carbon the atoms of sulphur or of a halogen which give them their nature of sulphonated or halogenated derivatives (or compound derivaties).

7. -    Headings 29.32, 29.33 and 29.34 do not include expoxides with a three-membered ring, ketone perorxides, cyclic polymers of aldehydes or of thioaldehydes, anhydrides of polybasic carboxylic acids, cyclic esters of polyhydric alcohols or phenols with polybasic acids, or imides of polybasic acids.

Theseprovisions apply only when the ring-position hetero-atoms are those resulting solely from the cyclising function or functions here listed.

8.-     For the purposes of heading 29.37:

(a)     the term “hormones” includes hormone-releasing or hormone-stimulating factors, hormone inhibitiors and hormone antagonists (anti-hormones);

(b)     the expression “used primarily as hormones” applies not only to hormone derivatives and structural analogues used primarily for their hormonal effect, but also to those derivatives and structural analogues used primarily as intermediates in the synthesis of products of this heading.

Subheading Note.

1.-     Within any one heading of this Chapter, derivatives of a chemical compound (or group of chemical compounds) are to be classified in the same subheading as that compound (or group of compounds) provided that they are not more specifically covered by any other subheading and that there is no residual subheading named “Other” in the series of subheadings concerned.

Notes.

1. -    Throughout the Nomenclature the expression “plastics” means those materials of headings 39.01 to 39.14 which are or have been capable, either at the moment of polymerization or at some subsequent stage, of being formed under external influence (usually heat and pressure, if necessary with a solvent or plasticiser ) by moulding, casting, extruding, rolling or other process into shapes which are retained on the removal of the external influence .

Throughoutthe Nomenclature any reference to “ plastics” also includes vulcanized fibre. The expression, however, does not apply to materials regarded as textile materials of section XI.

2. -    This Chapter does not cover:

(a)     Waxes of heading 27.12 or 34.04;

(b)     Separate chemically defined organic compound (Chapter 29);

(c)     Heparing or its salts (heading 30 .01);

(e)     Resols (heading 39.09) and other prepolymers.

4. -    The expression “copolymers” covers all polymers in which no single monomer unit contributes 95% or more by weight to the total polymer content.

For the purposes of this Chapter, except where the context otherwise requires, copolymers (including co-polycondensates, co-polyaddition products block copolymers and graft copolymers) and polymer blends are to be classified in the heading covering polymers of that comonomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For the purposes of this Note, constituent comonomer units of polymers falling in the same heading shall be taken together .

If no single comonomer units predominate, polymers or polymer blends, as the case may be, are to be classified in the heading which occurs last in numerical order among those which equally merit consideration.

5. -    Chemically modified polymer, that is those in which only appendages to the main polymer chain have been changed by chemical reaction, are to be classified in the heading appropriate to the unmodified polymer. This provision does not apply to graft copolymers .

6. -    In heading 39.01 to 39.14, the expression “ primary form” applies only to the following forms:

(a)     Liquids and paste, including dispersions (emulsions and suspension ) and solutions;

This expression also includes sausage casings and other lay-flat tubing. However, expect for the last – mention, those having an internal cross-section other than round, oval rectangular (in which the length does not exceed 1.5 times the width ) or in the shape of a regular polygon are not to be regarded as tubes, pipes and hoses but as profile shapes .

9. -    For the purposes of heading 39.18, the expression “wall or ceiling covering of plastics” applies to products in rolls, of a width not less than 45 cm, suitable for wall or ceiling decoration, consisting of plastic fixed permanently on a backing of any material other than paper, the layer of plastics (on face side ) being grained, embossed, coloured, design-printed or otherwise decorated.

10. - In headings 39.20 and 39.21, the expression “plates, sheet, film, foil and strip” applies only to plates sheets, film, foil and strip (other than those of chapter 54) and to blocks of regular geometric shape, whether or not printed or otherwise surface – worked, uncut or cut into rectangles (including squares) but not further worked (even if when so cut they become article ready for use ) .

11. - Heading 39.25 applies only to the following articles, not being products covered by any of the early heading of sub-Chapter II:

(a)     Reservoirs, tanks (including septic tanks ), vats and similar containers, of a capacity exceeding 3001;

(b)     Structural elements used, for example, in floors, walls or partitions, ceiling or roofs;

Subheading Notes.

1. –    Within any one heading of this Chapter, polymers (including copolymers) and chemically modified polymers are to be classified according to the following provisions:

(a)     Where there is a subheading named “Other” in the same series:

(1)     The designation in subheading of a polymer by the prefix “poly” (e.g, polyethylene and polyamide – 6,means that the constituent monomer unit or monomer units of the named polymer taken together must contribute 95% or more by weight of the total polymer content .

(2)     The copolymers named in subheadings 3901.30, 3903.20, 3903.30 and 3904.30 are to be classified in those subheadings, provided that  the comonomer units of the named copolymers contribute 95% or more by weight of the total polymer content .

(3)     Chemically modified polymers are to be classified in the subheading named “Other” provided that the chemically modified polymers are not more specifically covered by another subheading.

(4)     Polymers not meeting (1), (2) or (3) above, are to be classified in the subheading, among the remaining subheadings in the series, covering polymers of that monomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers failing in the same subheading shall be taken together. Only the constituent comonomer units of the polymers in the series of subheadings under consideration are to be compared.

(b)     Where there is to subheading named “other” in the same series:

(1)     polymers are to be classified in the subheading covering polymers of that monomer unit which predominates by weight over every other single comonomer unit. For this purpose, constituent monomer units of polymers falling in the same subheading shall be taken together. Only the constituent comonomer unit of the polymers in the series under consideration are to be compared .

(2.)    Chemically modified polymer are to be classified in the subheading appropriate to unmodified polymer .

polymer blends are to be classified in the same subheading as polymers of the same monomer units in the same proportions .

2. -    For the purposes of subheading 3920.43, the term “plasticisers” includes secondary plasticisers.

Rubber and articles thereof

Notes.

1. –    Except where the context otherwise requires, throughout the Nomenclature the expression “rubber” means the following products, whether or not vulcanized or hard: natural rubber, balata, gutta-percha, guayule, chicle and similar natural gums, synthetic rubber, factice derived from oils, and such substances reclaimed.

2. -    This Chapter does not cover:

(a)     Goods of section XI (textiles and textile articles);

(b)     Footwear or parts thereof of Chapter 64;

(c)     Headgear or parts thereof (including bathing caps ) of Chapter 65;

(d)     Mechanical or electrical appliances or parts thereof section XVI (including electrical goods of all kinds), of all rubber;

(e)     Articles of Chapter 90, 92, 94 or 96; or

(f)      Articles of Chapter 95 (other than sports gloves, mitten and mitts and articles of headings 40.11 to 40. 13 ).

3. -    In headings 40.01 to 40.03 and 40.05, the expression “primary forms” applies only to the following forms:

(a)     Liquids and pastes (including latex, whether or not pre-vulcanised, and other dispersions and solutions);

(b)     Blocks of irregular shape, lumps, bales, powders, granules, crumbs and similar bulk forms.

4. -    In Note 1 to this Chapter and in heading 40.02, the expression “ synthetic rub applies to:

(a)     Unsaturated synthetic substances which can be irreversibly transformed by vulcanisation with sulphur into non – thermoplastic substances which at a temperature between 18oC and 29oC, will not break on being extended to three times their original length and will return, after being extended to twice their original length, within a period of five minutes, to a length not greater than one and a half times their original length. For the purposes of this test, substances necessary for the cross-linking, such as vulcanizing activators or accelerators, may be added; the presence of substances as provided for by Note 5 (b) (ii) and (iii) is also permitted . However, the presence of any substances not necessary for the cross-linking, such as extender, plasticisers and filers, is not permitted;

(b)     Thioplasts (TM); and

(c)     Natural rubber modified by grafting or mixing with plastics, depolymerised natural rubber, mixtures of unsaturated synthetic substance with saturated synthetic high polymers provided that all the above- mentioned products comply with the requirements concerning vulcanization, elongation and recovery in (a) above.

5. -    (a) Headings 40.01 and 40.02 do not apply to any rubber or mixture of rubbers which has been compounded, before or after coagulation, with :

( i )    vulcanising agents, accelerators, retarders or activators (other than those added for the preparation of pre-vulcanised rubber latex);

(ii)     pigments or other colouring matter, other than those added solely for the purpose of identification;

(iii)    plasticisers or extenders (except mineral oil in the case of oil-extended rubber), fillers, reinforcing agents, organic solvents or any other substances, expect those permitted under (b);

(b)     The presence of the following substances in any rubber or mixture of rubbers shall not affect its classification in heading 40.01 or 40.02, as the case may be, provided that such rubber or mixture of rubbers retains its essential character as a raw material:

(i)      emulsifiers or anti-tack agents;

(ii)     small amounts of breakdown products of emulsifiers;

(iii)    very small amounts of the following: heat – sensitive agents (generally for obtaining thermosensitive rubber latexes), cationic surface-active agents(generally for obtaining electro-positive rubber latexes), antioxidants, coagulants, crumbing agents, freeze-resisting agents, peptisers, preservatives, stabilizer, viscosity-control agents or simila special- purpose additives.

6. -    For the purposes of heading 40.04, the expressions “waste, parings and scrap” means rubber waste, parings and scrap from the manufacture or working of rubber and rubber goods definitely not usable as such because of cutting–up, wear or other reasons.

7. -    Thread wholly of vulcanised rubber, of which any cross-sectional dimension exceeds 5mm, is to be classified as strip, rods or profile shapes, of heading 40.08 .

8. -    Heading 40.10 includes conveyor or transmission belts or belting of textile fabric impregnated, coated, covered or laminated with rubber or made from textile yarn or cord impregnated, coated, covered or sheathed with rubber.

9. -    In headings 40.01, 40.02, 40.03, 40.05 and 40.08, the expressions “plates” “sheets” and “strip” apply only to plates, sheets and strip and to block of regular geometric shape, uncut or simply cut to rectangular (including square) shape, whether or not having the character of articles and whether or not printed or otherwise surface – worked, but not otherwise cut to shape or further worked . In heading 40.08 the expressions “rods” and “profile shapes” apply only to such products, whether or not cut to length or surface-worked but not otherwise worked.

Yarn which:

(i)      has the natural colour of its constituent fibres and has not been bleached, dyed (whether or not in the mass) or printed; or

(ii)     is of indeterminate colour (“grey yarn”), manufactured from garneted stock.

Such yarn may have been treated with a colourless dressing or fugitive dye (which disappears after simple washing with soap) and, in the case of man-made fibres, treated in the mass with delustring agents (for example, titanium dioxide).

(c)     Bleached yarn

Yarn which :

(i)      has undergone a bleaching process, is made of bleached fibres or, unless the context otherwise requires, has been dyed white (whether or not in the mass) or treated with a white dressing;

Man-made filaments

Notes.

1. -    Throughout the Nomenclature, the term “man-made fibres” means staple fibres and filaments of organic polymers produced by manufacturing processes, either:

(a)     By polymerisation of organic monomers, such as polyamides, polyester, polyurethanes or polyvinyl derivatives; or

(b)     By chemical transformation of natural organic polymers (for example, cellulose, casein, proteins or algae), such as viscose rayon, cellulose acetate, cupro or alginates.

The terms “synthetic” and “artificial”, used in relation to fibres, means: synthetic: fibres as defined at (a); artificial: fibres as defined at (b).

The terms “man-made”, “synthetic” and “artificial” shall have the same meanings when used in relation to “textile materials”.

2. - Headings 54.02 and 54.03 do not apply to synthetic or artificial filament tow of

3. -    For the purposes of headings 61.03 and 61.04 :

(a)     The term “suit” means a set of garments composed of two or three pieces made up, in respect of their outer surface, in identical fabric and comprising :

- one suit coat or jacket the outer shell of which, exclusive of sleeves, consists of four or more panels, designed to cover the upper part of the body, possibly with a tailored waistcoat in addition whose front is made from the same fabric as the outer surface of the other components of the set and whose back is made from the same fabric as the lining of the suit coat or jacket; and

- one garment designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting of trousers, breeches or shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt, having neither braces nor bibs.

All of the components of a “suit” must be of the same fabric construction, colour and composition; they must also be of the same style and of corresponding or compatible size. However, these components may have piping (a strip of fabric sewn into the seam) in a different fabric.

If several separate components to cover the lower part of the body are presented together (for example, two pairs of trousers or trousers and shorts, or a skirt or divided skirt and trousers), the constituent lower part shall be one pair of trousers or, in the case of women’s or girls’ suits, the skirt or divided skirt, the other garments being considered separately.

The term “suit” includes the following sets of garments, whether or not they fulfil all the above conditions :

- morning dress, comprising a plain jacket (cutaway) with rounded tails hanging well down as back and striped trousers;

- evening dress (tailcoat), generally made of black fabric, the jacket of which is relatively short at the front, does not close and has narrow skirts cut in at the hips and hanging down behind;

- dinner jacket suits, in which the jacket is similar in style to an ordinary jacket (though perhaps revealing more of the shirt front), but has shiny silk or

imitationsilk lapels.

(b)     The term “ensemble” means a set of garments (other than suits and articles of heading 61.07, 61.08 or 61.09), composed of several pieces made up in identical fabric, put up for retail sale, and comprising :

- one garment designed to cover the upper part of the body, with the exception of pullovers which may form a second upper garment in the sole context of twin sets, and of waistcoats which may also form a second upper garment, and

- one or two different garments, designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting of trousers, bib and brace overalls, breeches, shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt.

All of the components of an ensemble must be of the same fabric construction, style, colour and composition; they also must be of corresponding or compatible size. The term “ensemble” does not apply to track suits or ski suits, of heading 61.12.

- one pair of trousers whether or not extending above waist-level, one pair of breeches or one bib and brace overall.

The “ski ensemble” may also consist of an overall similar to the one mentioned in paragraph (a) above and a type of padded, sleeveless jacket worn over the overall.

All the components of a “ski ensemble” must be made up in a fabric of the same texture, style and composition whether or not of the same colour; they also must be of corresponding or compatible size.

8. -    Garments which are, prima facie, classifiable both in heading 61.13 and in other headings of this Chapter, excluding heading 61.11, are to be classified in heading 61.13.

Chapter 62

Articles of apparel and clothing accessories, not knitted or crocheted

Notes.

1. - This Chapter applies only to made up articles of any textile fabric other than wadding, excluding knitted or crocheted articles (other than those of heading 62.12).

2. -    This Chapter does not cover:

(a)     Worn clothing or other worn articles of heading 63.09; or

(b)     Orthopaedic appliances, surgical belts, trusses or the like (heading 90.21).

3. -    For the purposes of headings 62.03 and 62.04:

(a)     The term “suit” means a set of garments composed of two or three pieces made up, in respect of their outer surface, in identical fabrics and comprising:

- one suit coat or jacket the outer shell of which, exclusive of sleeves, consists of four or more panels, designed to cover the upper part of the body, possibly with a tailored waistcoat in addition whose front is made from the same fabric as the outer surface of the other components of the set and whose back is made from the same fabric as the lining of the suit coat or jacket; and

- one garment designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting of trousers, breeches or shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt, having neither braces nor bibs.

All of the components of a “suit” must be of the same fabric construction, colour and composition; they must also be of the same style and of corresponding or compatible size. However, these components may have piping (a strip of fabric sewn into the seam) in a different fabric.

If several separate components to cover the lower part of the body are presented together (for example, two pairs of trousers or trousers and shorts, or a skirt or divided skirts and trousers), the constituent lower part shall be one pair of trousers or, in the case of women’s or girls’ suits, the skirt or divided skirt, the other garments being considered separately.

The term “suit” includes the following sets of garments, whether or not they fulfil all the above conditions:

- morning dress, comprising a plain jacket (cutaway) with rounded tails hanging well down at the back and striped trousers;

- evening dress (tailcoat), generally made of black fabric, the jacket of which is relatively short at the front, does not close and has narrow skirts cut in at the hips and hanging down behind;

- dinner jacket suits, in which the jacket is similar in style to an ordinary jacket (though perhaps revealing more of the shirt front), but has shiny silk or imitation silk lapels;

(b)     The term “ensemble” means a set of garments (other than suits and articles of heading 62.07 or 62.08) composed of several pieces made up in identical fabric, put up for retail sale, and comprising:

- one garment designed to cover the upper part of the body, with the exception of waistcoats which may also form a second upper garment, and

- one or two different garments, designed to cover the lower part of the body and consisting of trousers, bib and brace overalls, breeches, shorts (other than swimwear), a skirt or a divided skirt.

All of the components of an ensemble must be of the same fabric construction, style, colour and composition; they also must be of corresponding or compatible size. The term “ensemble” does not apply to track suits or ski suits, of heading 62.11.

4. -    For the purposes of heading 62.09:

(a)     The expression “babies’ garments and clothing accessories” means articles for young children of a body height not exceeding 86 cm; it also covers babies’ napkins;

(b)     Articles which are, prima facie, classifiable both in heading 62.09 and in other headings of this Chapter are to be classified in heading 62.09.

5. -    Garments which are, prima facie, classifiable both in heading 62.10 and in other headings of this Chapter, excluding heading 62.09, are to be classified in heading 62.10.

6. -    For the purposes of heading 62.11, “ski suits” means garments or sets of garments which, by their general appearance and texture, are identifiable as intended to be worn principally for skiing (cross-country or alpine). They consist either of:

(a)     A “ski overall”, that is, a one-piece garment designed to cover the upper and the lower parts of the body; in addition to sleeves and a collar the ski overall may have pockets or footstraps; or

(b)     a “ski ensemble”, that is, a set of garments composed of two or three pieces, put up for retail sale and comprising:

- one garment such as an anorak, wind-cheater, wind-jacket or similar article, closed by a slide fastener (zipper), possibly with a waistcoat in addition, and

- one pair of trousers whether or not extending above waist-level, one pair of breeches or one bib and brace overall.

The “ski ensemble” may also consist of an overall similar to the one mentioned in paragraph (a) above and a type of padded, sleeveless jacket worn over the overall.

All the components of a “ski ensemble” must be made up in a fabric of the same texture, style and composition whether or not of the same colour; they also must be of corresponding or compatible size.

7. -    Scarves and articles of the scarf type, square or approximately square, of which no side exceeds 60cm, are to be classified as handkerchiefs (heading 62.13). Handkerchiefs of which any side exceeds 60 cm are to be classified in heading 62.14.

8. -    Garments of this Chapter designed for left over right closure at the front shall be regarded as men’s or boys’ garments, and those designed for right over left closure at the front as women’s or girls’ garments. These provisions do not apply where the cut of the garment clearly indicates that it is designed for one or other of the sexes.

Garmentswhich cannot be identified as either men’s or boys’ garments or as women’s or girls’ garments are to be classified in the headings covering women’s or girls’ garments.

9. -    Articles of this Chapter may be made of metal thread.

2.       - For the classification of ferro-alloys in the subheadings of heading 72.02 the

following rule should be observed; A ferro-alloy is considered as binary and classified under the relevant subheading (if it exists) if only one of the alloy elements exceeds the minimum percentage laid down in Chapter Note 1 (c); by analogy, it is considered respectively as ternary or quaternary if two or three alloy elements exceed the minimum percentage. For the application of this rule, the unspecified “other elements” referred to in

Chapter Note 1 (c) must each exceed 10% by weight.

Copper and articles thereof

Notes.

1. – In this Chapter the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:

(a) Refined copper

Metalcontaining at least 99.85% by weight of copper; or

Metalcontaining at least 97.5% by weight of copper, provided that the content by weight of any other element does not exceed the limit specified in the following table:

TABLE - Other elements

Element                          Limiting content % by weight

Ag Silver                                   0.25

As Arsenic                                0.5

Cd Cadmium                            1.3

Cr Chromium                            1.4

MgMagnesium                         0.8

Pb Lead                                    1.5

S Sulphur                                 0.7

Sn Tin                                      0.8

TeTellurium                             0.8

Zn Zinc                                     1

ZrZirconium                             0.3

Other e lements*, each. 0.3

*Other elements are, for example, A1, Be, Co, Fe, Mn, Ni, Si.

(b)     Copper alloys

Metallicsubstances other than unrefined copper in which copper predominates by weight over each of the other elements, provided that:

(i)      the content by weight of at least one of the other elements is greater than the limit specified in the foregoing table; or

(ii)     the total content by weight of such other elements exceed 2.5%

(c)     Master alloys

Alloyscontaining with other elements more than 10% by weight of copper, not usefully malleable and commonly used as an additive in the manufacture of other alloys or as de-oxidants, de-sulphurising agents or for similar uses in the metallurgy of non-ferrous metals.

However,copper phosphide (phosphor copper) containing more than 15% by weight of phosphorus falls in heading 28.48.

(d)     Bars and rods

Rolled,extruded, drawn or forged products, nor in coils, which have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including “flattened circles” and “modified rectangles”, of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel). Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal cross-section may have corners rounded along their whole length. The thickness of such products which have a rectangular (including “modified rectangular”) cross-section exceeds one-tenth of the width. The expression also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms and dimensions, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming or de-scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings.

Wire-barsand billets with their ends tapered or otherwise worked simple to facilitate their entry into machines for converting them into, for example, drawing stock (wire-rod) or tubes, are however to be taken to be unwrought copper of heading 74.03.

(e)     Profiles

Rolled,extruded, drawn, forged or formed products, coiled or not, of a uniform crosssection along their whole length, which do not conform to any of the definitions of bars, rods, wire, plates, sheets, strip, foil, tubes or pipes. The expression also covers cast or sintered products, of the same forms, which have been subsequently worked after production (otherwise than by simple trimming or de-scaling), provided that they have not thereby assumed the character of articles or products of other headings.

(f)      Wire

Rolled,extruded or drawn products, in coils, which have a uniform solid cross-section along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons (including “flattened circles” and “modified rectangles”, of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal length and parallel). Products with a rectangular (including square), triangular or polygonal cross-section may have corners rounded along their whole length.

Thethickness of such products which have a rectangular (including “modified rectangular”) cross section exceeds one-tenth of the width.

In the case of heading 74.14, however, the term “wire” applies only to products, whether or not in coils, of any cross-sectional shape, of which no cross-sectional dimension exceeds 6mm.

(g)     Plates, sheets, strip and foil

Flat-surfacedproducts (other than the unwrought products of heading 74.03), coiled or not, of solid rectangular (other than square) cross-section with or without rounded corners (including “modified rectangles” of which two opposite sides are convex arcs, the other two sides being straight, of equal and parallel) of a uniform thickness, which are:

- of rectangular length (including square) shape with a thickness not exceeding one tenth of the width,

- of a shape other than rectangular or square, of any size, provided that they do not assume the character of articles or products of other headings.

Headings74.09 and 74.10 apply, inter alia, to plates, sheets, strip and foil with patterns (for example, grooves, ribs, chequers, tears, buttons, lozenges) and to such products which have been perforated, corrugated, polished or coated, provided that they do not thereby assume the character of articles or products of other headings.

(h)     Tubes and pipes

Hollowproducts, coiled or not, which have a uniform cross-section with only one enclosed void along their whole length in the shape of circles, ovals, rectangles (including squares), equilateral triangles or regular convex polygons, and which have a uniform wall thickness.

Productswith a rectangular (including square), equilateral triangular or regular convex polygonal cross-section, which may have corners rounded along their whole length, are also to be taken to be tubes and pipes provided the inner and outer cross-sections are concentric and have the same form and orientation. Tubes and pipes of the foregoing crosssections may be polished, coated, bent, threaded, drilled, waisted, expanded, cone-shape or fitted with flanges, collars or rings.

Subheading Note.

1. -    In this Chapter the following expressions have the meanings hereby assigned to them:

(a).    Copper-zinc base alloys (brasses)

Alloys of copper and zinc, with or without other elements. When other elements are present:

- zinc predominates by weight over each of such other elements;

- any nickel content by weight is less than 5% (see copper-zinc alloys (nickel silvers)}; and

- any tin content by weight is less than 3% (see copper-tin alloys bronzes).

(b)     Copper-tin based alloys (bronzes)

Alloys of copper and tin, with or without other elements. When other elements are present, tin predominates by weight over each of such other elements, except that when the tin content is 3 % or more the zinc content by weight may exceed that of tin but must be less than 10%.

(c)Copper-nickel-zinc base alloys (nickel silvers)

Alloys of copper, nickel and zinc, with or without other elements. The nickel content is 5% or more by weight (see copper-zinc alloys (brasses)).

(d)Copper-nickel base alloys

Alloys of copper and nickel, with or without other elements but in any case containing by weight not more than 1 % of zinc. When other elements are present, nickel predominates

by weight over each of such other elements.

1. -    This Chapter does not cover:

(a)     Electrically warmed blankets, bed pads, foot-muffs or the like; electrically warmed clothing, footwear or ear pads or other electrically warmed articles worn on or about the person;

(b)     Articles of glass of heading 70.11; or

(c)     Electrically heated furniture of Chapter 94

2. -    Headings 85.01 to 85.04 do not apply to goods described in heading 85.11, 85.12, 85.40, 85.41 or 85.42. However, metal tank mercury arc rectifiers remain classified in heading No. 85.04.

3. -    Heading 85.09 covers only the following electro-mechanical machines of the kind commonly used for domestic purposes:

(a)     Vacuum cleaners, including dry and wet vacuum cleaners’ floor polishers, food grinders and mixers , and fruit or vegetable juice extractors, of any weight;

(b)     Other machines provided the weight of such machines does not exceed 20kg.

The heading does not, however, apply to fans or ventilating or recycling hoods incorporating a fan, whether or not fitted with filters (heading 84.14), centrifugal clothesdryers (heading 84.21), dish washing machines (heading 84.22), household washing machines (heading 84.50), roller or other ironing machines (heading 84.20 or 84.51), sewing machines (heading 84.52), electric scissors (heading 84.67) or to electrothermic appliances (heading 85.16).

4. -    For the purposes of heading 85.34 “printed circuits” are circuits obtained by forming on an insulating base, by any printing process (for example, embossing, plating-up, etching) or by “film circuit” technique, conductor elements, contacts or other printed components (for example, inductances, resistors, capacitors) alone or interconnected according to a preestablished pattern, other than elements which can produce, rectify, modulate or amplify an electrical signal (for example, semiconductor elements).

The expression “printed circuits” not cover circuits combined with elements other than those obtain during the printing process, nor does it cover individual, discrete resistors, capacitors or inductances. Printed circuits may, however, be fitted with non-printed connecting elements.

Thin-orthick-film circuits comprising passive and active elements obtained duringnthe same technological process are to be classified in heading 85.42.

5. -    For the purposes of headings 85.41 and 85.42:

(A)     “Diodes, transistors and similar semiconductor devices” are semiconductor devices the operation of which depends on variations in resistively on the application of an electric field;

(B)     “Electronic integrated circuits and microassemblies” are:

(a)     Monolithic integrated circuits in which the circuit elements (diodes, transistors, capacitors, interconnections, etc.) are created in the mass (essentially) and on the surface of a semiconductor material (doped silicon, for example) and are inseparably associated;

(b)     Hybrid integrated circuits in which passive elements (resistors, capacitors, interconnections, etc.), obtained by thin-or thick-film technology, and active elements (diodes, transistors, monolithic integrated circuits, etc.), obtained by semiconductor technology, are combined to all intents and purposes indivisibly, on a single insulating substrate (glass, ceramic, etc.).

Thesecircuits may also include discrete components;

(c)     Microassemblies of the moulded module, micromodule or similar types, consisting or discrete, active or both active and passive, components which are combined and interconnected.

For the classification of the articles defined in this Note, headings 85.41 and 85.42 shall take precedence over any other heading in the Nomenclature which might cover them by reference to, in particular, their function.

6.-     Records, tapes and other media of heading 85.23 or 85.24 remain classified in those heading when presented with the apparatus for which they are intended.

This Note does not apply to such media when they are presented with articles other than the apparatus for which they are intended.

7. -    For the purposes of heading 85.48, “spent primary cells, spent primary batteries and spent electric accumulators” are those which are neither usable as such because of breakage,cutting-up, wear or other reasons, nor capable of being recharged.

Subheading Notes.

1. -    Subheadings 8519.92 and 8527.12 cover only cassette-players with built-inamplifier, without built-in loudspeaker, capable of operating without an external source of electric power and the dimensions of which do not exceed 170mm x 100mm x 45 mm.

2. -    For the purposes of subheading 8542.10, the term “smart cards” means cards which have embedded in them an electronic integrated circuit (microprocessor) of any type in the form of a chip and which may or may not have a magnetic stripe.
