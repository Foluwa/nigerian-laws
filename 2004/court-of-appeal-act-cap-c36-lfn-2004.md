16.   The Court of Appeal may, from time to time, make any order necessary for determining the real question in controversy in the appeal, and may amend any defect or error in the record of appeal, and may direct the court below to inquire into and certify its findings on any question which the Court of Appeal thinks fit to determine before final judgment in the appeal and may make an interim order or grant any injunction which the court below is authorised to make or grant and may direct any necessary inquiries or accounts to be made or taken and generally shall have full jurisdiction over the whole proceedings as if the proceedings had been instituted in the Court of Appeal as court of first instance and may re-hear the case in whole or in part or may remit it to the court below for the purpose of such re-hearing or may give such other directions as to the manner in which the court below shall deal with the case in accordance with the powers of that court, or, in the case of an appeal from the court below in that court's appellate jurisdiction, order the case to be re-heard by a court of competent jurisdiction.

17.            The Court of Appeal shall not grant a new trial or reverse any judgment by reason of the ruling of any court that the stamp upon any document is sufficient or that the document does not require a stamp.

18.  An appeal under this Part of this Act shall not operate as a stay of execution, but the Court of Appeal may order a stay of execution either unconditionally or upon the performance of such conditions as may be imposed in accordance with rules of court.

### Part III: Appeals in Criminal cases from a Court sitting as a Court of First instance

19.  This Part of this Act shall apply to the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to hear appeals in criminal causes or matters from decisions of the court below sitting at first instance.

20. (1) The Court of Appeal on any appeal under this Part of this Act against conviction or against an order of acquittal, discharge or dismissal, shall allow the appeal if it thinks that the verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court below should be set aside on the ground of a wrong decision on any question of law or that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice and in any other case, the Court of Appeal shall, subject to the provisions of subsection (3) of this section and section 21 of this Act, dismiss the appeal:

Providedthat the Court of Appeal may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point raised in the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.

(2)    Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Court of Appeal shall, if it allows an appeal against conviction, quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered or order the appellant to be re-tried by a court of competent jurisdiction.

(3)    On an appeal against sentence or, subject to the provisions of this Act, on an appeal against conviction, the Court of Appeal shall, if it thinks that a different sentence should have been passed, quash the sentence passed at the trial and pass such other sentence warranted in law (whether more or less severe) in substitution therefor as it thinks ought to have been passed, and if not of that opinion shall, in the appeal against sentence, dismiss the appeal.

(4)    Subject to the provisions of this Act, the Appeal shall, if it allows an appeal against acquittal or dismissal, direct a judgment and verdict of conviction entered and pass such sentence as the court below passed, or order the appellant to be re-tried by competent jurisdiction.

21. (1) If it appears to the Court of Appeal that an appellant, though not properly convicted on some count or part of the information or charge, has been properly convicted on some other count or part of the information or charge, the Court of Appeal may either affirm the sentence passed appellant at the trial, or pass such sentence in substitution therefor as it thinks proper, and as may be warranted in law by the verdict on the count or part of the information or charge on which the Court of Appeal considers that the appellant has been properly convicted.

(2)    Where an appellant has been convicted of and the court which tried him could on the information or charge have found him guilty of some other offence, and on the finding of the trial court, it appears to the Court of Appeal that that court must have been satisfied of facts which proved him guilty of that other offence, the Court of A instead of allowing or dismissing the appeal, substitute for the verdict found by such court, a verdict of guilty of that offence and pass such sentence in substitution for the sentence passed at the trial as may be warranted in law for that other offence, not being a sentence of greater severity.

(3)    If on any appeal it appears to the Court of Appeal that, although the appellant was guilty of the act or omission charged against him, he was insane at the time the act was done or omission made so as not to be responsible according to law for his action, the Court of Appeal may quash the sentence passed at the trial and order the appellant to be kept in custody as a person of unsound mind in such place and in such manner as the Court of Appeal may direct pleasure of the President of the Federal Republic, be known, and the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria may thereupon and from time to time, give such order for the safe custody of the appellant during pleasure in such place and in such manner as the President of the Federal Republic of Nigeria may see fit.

22. (1) Where any law in force in the State from which an appeal is brought has suspended the operation of any order made on conviction by the court before which the appellant was convicted, for the payment of compensation or of any of the expenses of the prosecution, or for the imprisonment or other punishment imposed on the person convicted or for the restoration of any property to any person, and the re-vesting in case of any such conviction in the original owner or his personal representative of the property in stolen goods, such order shall continue to be suspended until the determination of the appeal if notice of appeal, or notice of application for leave to appeal is given within thirty days of the date of the conviction.

(2)    In cases where the operation of an order is suspended until the determination of the appeal, the order shall not take effect if the conviction is quashed on appeal.

(3)    The Court of Appeal may by order annul or vary any order made by the court before which the appellant was convicted for the payment of compensation or of any other expenses of the prosecution or for the imprisonment or other punishment imposed on the person convicted or for the restoration of any property to any person although the conviction is not quashed, and the order, if annulled, shall not take effect, and, if varied, shall take effect as so varied.

### Part IV: Appeals in Criminal cases from a Court sitting in its appellate jurisdiction

23.   This Part of this Act shall apply to the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to hear appeals from decisions of the court below in criminal causes or matters in which an appeal has been brought to the court below from some other court.

(4)    The Court of Appeal may extend the periods prescribed in subsections (2) and (3) of this section.

26.   The Court of Appeal may, at any time assign counsel to an appellant in any appeal or proceedings preliminary or incidental to an appeal in which, in the opinion of the Court of Appeal, it appears desirable in the interest of justice that the appellant should have legal assistance, and that he has not sufficient means to enable him to obtain that assistance.

27.   In the exercise of its jurisdiction, the Court of Appeal may, if it thinks it necessary or expedient in the interest of Justice-

(a)    order the production of any document, exhibit, or other thing connected with the proceedings, the production of which appears to it necessary for the determination of the case;

(b)    order any witnesses who would have been compellable witnesses at the trial to attend and be examined before the Court of Appeal, whether they were or were not called at the trial, or order the examination of any such witnesses to be conducted in manner provided by rules of court, or, in the absence of rules of court making provision in that behalf, as it may direct, before any Justice of the Court of Appeal or before any officer of the Court of Appeal or other person appointed by the Court of Appeal for the purpose, and allow the admission of any depositions so taken as evidence before the Court of Appeal;

(c)    receive the evidence, if tendered, of any witness (including the appellant) who is competent but not compellable witness, and, if the appellant makes an application for the purpose, of the husband or wife of the appellant, in cases where the evidence of the husband or wife could not have been given at the trial except on such an application; and

(d)    where any question arising on the appeal involves prolonged examination of documents or accounts, or any scientific or local investigation, which cannot in the opinion of the Court of Appeal conveniently be conducted before the Court of Appeal, order the reference of the question in matter provided by rules of court, or in the absence of rules of court making provision in that behalf, as it may direct, for enquiry and report, to a special commissioner appointed by the Court of Appeal, and act upon the report of any such commissioner so far as it thinks fit to adopt it; and exercise in relation to the proceedings of the Court of Appeal, any other powers which may for the time being be prescribed by rules of court, and issue any warrants necessary for enforcing the orders or sentences of the Court of Appeal:

Provided that in no case shall a sentence be increased by reason of or in consideration of any evidence that was not given at the trial.

28. (1) On the hearing of an appeal in a criminal cause or matter, an appellant, notwithstanding that he is in custody, shall be entitled to be present, if he so desires, except where the appeal is on some ground involving a question of law alone, but in that ease, and on an application for leave to appeal and on any proceedings preliminary or incidental to an appeal, he shall not be entitled to be present, unless where rules of court provide that he shall have the right to be present or where the Court of Appeal gives him leave to be present.

(2)    The power of the Court of Appeal to pass any sentence under this Act may be exercised notwithstanding that the appellant is for any reason not present.

(2)      The time during which an appellant, pending the determination of his appeal, is admitted to bail shall not count as part of any term of imprisonment under his sentence and, any imprisonment under the sentence of an appellant, whether it is the sentence passed by the trial court or the sentence passed by the court below on appeal or the sentence of the Court of Appeal, shall, subject to any direction which may be given by the Court of Appeal, be deemed to be resumed or to begin to run, as the case requires, from the day on which he is received into prison under the sentence.

(3)      In any case in which the appellant has received special treatment pending the hearing of his appeal in accordance with the provisions of any law relating to prisons, the Court of Appeal shall fix the day from which the sentence shall be deemed to begin to run.

30.     If it appears to the Registrar that any notice of appeal against a conviction purporting to be on a ground of appeal which involves a question of law alone does not show any substantial ground of appeal, the Registrar may refer the appeal to any Justice of the Court of Appeal and such Justice may, if he is of the same opinion, direct the Registrar to refer the appeal to the Court of Appeal for summary determination, and, when the case is so referred, the Court of Appeal may if it considers that the appeal is frivolous or vexatious, and can be determined without adjourning the same for a full hearing, dismiss the appeal summarily without calling on any persons to attend the hearing or to appear for the State thereon.
