Weights and measures (primary standards) order

[under section 47]

[1st December, 1965] [Commencement.]

1.     Short title, extent and commencement

(1)    ThisOrder may be cited as the Weights and Measures (Primary Standards) Order and shall apply throughout the Federation.

(2)    ThisOrder shall come into force on 1 December 1965, and accordingly the existing standards which, but for the fact that this Order comes into force on 1 December 1965, would under the Act become the Nigerian primary imperial standards on that date, shall cease to be standards for Nigeria on that date.

2.     The Nigerian primary standards

(1)    The Nigerian primary standards of weights and measures are hereby declared to be—

(a)    in the case of the metre, the nickel steel bar described in Part I of the Schedule of this Order;

(b)    in the case of the kilogramme, the stainless steel cylinder described in Part II of the Schedule of this Order;

(c)    in the case of the pound, the stainless steel mass described in Part III of the Schedule of this Order;

(d)    in the case of the yard, the nickel steel bar described in Part IV of the Schedule of this Order.

(2)    Thesaid Nigerian primary standards of the metre, kilogramme, pound and yard shall be under the custody of the Director-General of the Ministry of Trade and Tourism.

Schedule

THE NIGERIAN PRIMARY STANDARDS

### PART I

The Nigerian primary standard of the metre

A bar of nickel steel of “H”-section about 103 centimetres in length and 24 millimetres square in overall section marked “SIP GENEVE No. 12202 20°C NI 58%.” The upper surface of the web of the “H” is chromed and highly polished and is engraved with a main scale of fine transverse lines 1 centimetre apart numbered “0” to “100”, the spaces between these lines being further divided by shorter  transverse lines 1 millimetre apart. This scale is cut by two longitudinal fine lines parallel to the axis of the bar. The length of the Nigerian Primary Standard Metre shall be measured between those two fine transverse lines of the main scale which are marked “0” and “100”, the plane of measurement to be co-incidental with the upper surface of the web of the “H” and the line of measurement to be halfway between the two fine longitudinal lines and parallel thereto. Measurement shall be made at a temperature of 20° Celsius, the bar being supported on rollers approximately 1 centimetre in diameter at the points indicated by the arrows on one flank of the bar.

### PART II

The Nigerian primary standard of the kilogramme

A solid cylinder of non-magnetic stainless steel approximately 5.5 centimetres in diameter and 5.5 centimetres in height marked “FNI 1kg.”

### PART III

The Nigerian primary standard of the pound

A solid mass of non-magnetic stainless steel of cylindrical shape with a knob marked “1 lb. FN2” the cylindrical part being approximately 4 centimetres in diameter and 4 centimetres in height.

### PART IV

The Nigerian primary standard of the yard

A bar of nickel steel of “H”-section about 42 inches long and about 1 inch square in overall section marked “Hilger and Watts Ltd. London No. 224/63/244. Standard at 68°F”. The upper surface of one of the uprights of the “H” is engraved with a coarse scale of 41 transverse lines about 1 inch apart and numbered consecutively “0” to “40” and the space between each of these transverse lines is divided into 20 equal parts by shorter transverse lines. The upper surface of the web of the “H” is chromed and highly polished and is engraved with a main scale of fine transverse lines corresponding to the coarse scale and this main scale is cut by two longitudinal fine lines parallel to the axis of the bar. The length of the Nigerian Primary Standard Yard shall be measured between those two fine transverse lines of the main scale which correspond respectively to the lines marked “0” and “36” on the coarse scale, the plane of measurement to be coincidental with the upper surface of the web of the “H” and the line of measurement to be half way between the two fine longitudinal lines and parallel thereto. Measurement shall be made at a temperature of 20° Celsius, the bar being supported on rollers approximately 1 centimetre in diameter at the points indicated by the arrows engraved on one of the flanks of the bar.

Weights and measures (definition of units) order

[1st December, 1965]

[Commencement.]

1.     Short title and extent

This Order may be cited as the Weights and Measures (Definition of Units) Order 1965 and shall apply throughout the Federation.

2.     Definition of units

The metre, litre, kilogramme, ampere, ohm, volt and watt shall for the purposes of measurement falling to be made in Nigeria have the meanings respectively assigned to them in the Schedule hereto, being the meanings appearing to the Minister to reproduce in English the international definitions of those units in force at the date of the making of this Order.

Schedule

DEFINITION OF UNITS OF MEASUREMENT

Measurement of length

METRE

The metre is the length equal to 1 650 763.73 wavelengths in vacuum of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the level 2p 10 and 5d 5 of the Krypton 86 atom.

(General conference of Weights and Measures held in Paris in 1960).

Measurement of capacity

LITRE

The litre is the volume occupied by a mass of 1 kilogramme of pure water at its maximum density and under standard atmospheric pressure.

(General Conference of Weights and Measures held in Paris in 1901).

Measurement of mass

KILOGRAMME

The kilogramme is the unit of mass represented by the mass of the international prototype kilogramme.

(General Conference of Weights and Measures held in Paris in 1901).

Measurement of electricity

AMPERE

The ampere is the constant current which, if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length and of negligible circular section and placed 1 metre apart in vacuum will produce between the conductors a force equal to 2 x 10-7 M.K.S. units of force per metre of length.

(General Conference of Weights and Measures held in Paris in 1948).

OHM

The ohm is the electrical resistance between two points of a conductor when a constant difference of potential of 1 volt applied between the two points produces in the conductor a current of 1 ampere, the conductor not being the seat of any electromotive force.

(General Conference of Weights and Measures held in Paris in 1948).

VOLT

The volt is the difference of electrical potential between two points of conducting wire carrying a constant current of 1 ampere when the power dissipated between these two points is equal to 1 watt.

(General Conference of Weights and Measures held in Paris in 1948).

WATT

The watt is the power which gives rise to the production of energy at 1 joule per second. (General Conference of Weights and Measures held in Paris in 1948).

Note.—The reference in relation to each definition to a General Conference of Weights and Measures is a reference to the General Conference of Weights and Measures (convened by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures) at which that definition was recognised.
