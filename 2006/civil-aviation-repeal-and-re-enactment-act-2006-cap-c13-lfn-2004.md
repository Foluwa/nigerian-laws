### PART V - Fatigue of flight crew

43.   Application, interpretation and modification of Part V

(1)    Regulations 44 to 48, inclusive, of these Regulations shall apply in relation to an aircraft if, but only if, it is an aircraft registered in Nigeria which is either‐

(a)    engaged on a flight for the purpose of public transport; or

(b)    operated by an air transport undertaking:

Provided that the said Regulations shall not apply in relation to a flight made only for the purpose of instruction in flying given by or on behalf of a flying club or a flying school, or a person who is not an air transport undertaking.

(2)    In this Part of these Regulations, the following expressions shall, except where the context otherwise requires, have the meanings hereby respectively assigned to them, that is

(a)    "flight time", in relation to any person, means all time spent by that person in an aircraft while it is in flight and he is carried therein as a member of the flight crew thereof;

(b)    "duty period", in relation to any person who flies in an aircraft as a member of the flight crew thereof, means any continuous period throughout which he is, under the provisions of paragraph (3) or (4) of this regulation, to be treated as being on duty:

Provided that where two or more periods which would, but for this proviso, be separate duty periods, are separated by an interval of less than ten hours, the period starting when the first of those duty periods began and finishing when the last of them ended shall be treated as constituting a single continuous duty period;

(c)    "restperiod", in relation to any person, means any continuous period, no part of which forms part of a duty period of that person.

(3)    For the purposes of this Part of these Regulations, a person who is employed under a contract of service to fly in an aircraft as a member of the flight crew thereof shall be treated as being on duty at any time when in the course of that employment he flies in any aircraft (whether as a member of its crew or as a passenger and whether or not the aircraft is such an aircraft as is referred to in paragraph (1) of this regulation) or he is otherwise acting in the course of that employment:

Provided that when he is not flying in an aircraft‐

(a)    subject to paragraph (c) of this proviso, he shall not be treated as being on duty during any period which he is allowed for rest;

(b)    subject to paragraph (c) of this proviso, he shall not be treated as being on duty at any time by reason only of his being required at that time to be available at a particular place to report for duty if required to do so;

(c)    he shall be treated as being on duty at any time when he is required to be available at a particular place to report for duty if required to do so if‐

(i)     that place is at an aerodrome; or

(ii)    that place, not being at an aerodrome, is a place at which his employer requires persons similarly employed to be available as aforesaid and adequate facilities for rest are not available for his use while he is required to be so available.

(4)    For the purposes of this Part of these Regulations, a person who flies in an aircraft as a member of the flight crew thereof, otherwise than in the course of his employment under a contract of service to fly as aforesaid, shall be treated as being on duty at any time when, in connection with any business of operating aircraft, he flies in any aircraft (whether as a member of its crew or as a passenger and whether or not the aircraft is such an aircraft as is referred to in paragraph (1) of this regulation) or does any work.

(5)    For the purposes of this Part of these Regulations, references to a person flying in an aircraft as a member of the flight crew thereof, include references to the operator of the aircraft who himself flies in the aircraft in any such capacity and references to the work and other duties which a person is required or permitted by an operator to carry out, shall in any such case be construed as references to any work carried out by that operator in connection with the managements of aircraft or with any business which includes the flying of aircraft.

(6)    Notwithstanding the provisions of this regulation and regulations 44 to 50 of these Regulations, the Minister may by Regulations modify or replace the provisions of this regulation (other than this paragraph) or any or all of those Regulations in their application to Nigeria if he considers that the prevention of excessive fatigue of the flight crew of aircraft registered in Nigeria will thereby be more suitably ensured.

44.   Duties of operators to prevent fatigue to flight crew

It shall be the duty of every operator of an aircraft to which this regulation applies to ensure, as respects each person flying as a member of the flight crew of that aircraft, that the periods during which that person is required or permitted by that operator to carry out any work or other duties are so limited in length and frequency, and that that person is afforded such periods for rest, that his said work and duties are not likely to cause him such fatigue while he is flying in the aircraft as may endanger the safety thereof.

45.   Limits on flying time, duty periods and rest periods

(1)    Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 44 of these Regulations, and for the purposes of securing that the requirements of those provisions are complied with, every operator of an aircraft to which this regulation applies, shall establish for every person flying in that aircraft as a member of the flight crew thereof‐

(a)    limits on the aggregate of all his flight times during every period of thirty consecutive days;

(b)    limits on his flying duty periods; and

(c)    minimum rest periods which he is to have immediately before any duty period in the course of which he makes any such flight as aforesaid, being limits and minimum rest periods which the operator is satisfied after taking into account the matters mentioned in paragraph (2) of this regulation, are such that, if every member of the flight crew observes those limits and has those minimum rest periods, the safety of the aircraft on any flight is not likely to be endangered by reason of any fatigue which may be caused by the work or other duties which the members of the flight crew are required or permitted by that operator to carry out. Different limits and different minimum rest periods may be established either for different persons or for different classes of persons and for different circumstances.

(2)    The matters which an operator shall take into account in establishing under paragraph (1) of this regulation limits and minimum rest periods as therein mentioned for the persons therein mentioned, are the nature of the work and other duties which those persons will carry out and all circumstances arising out of the carrying out of that work and those duties which may affect the degree of fatigue from which those persons may suffer while they are making a flight in an aircraft to which this regulation applies in any such capacity as is mentioned in paragraph (1) of this regulation.

(3)    No limits or minimum rest periods may be established under paragraph (1) of this regulation which would require or permit any person to fly in any aircraft at a time when such flying would constitute a contravention of any of the provisions of regulations 46, 47 and 49 of these Regulations.

(4)    An operator of an aircraft to which this regulation applies shall not permit an aircraft to make a flight unless limits and minimum rest periods have been established in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this regulation so as to apply to every member of the flight crew thereof.

(5)    Every operator of an aircraft to which this regulation applies shall take all such steps as are reasonably practicable to secure that all limits for the time being established by that operator in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this regulation are observed and that no person for whom minimum rest periods are for the time being so established, makes any flight in an aircraft to which this regulation applies unless, immediately before the duty period in the course of which he makes the flight, he has had the appropriate rest period so established.

(6)    Notwithstanding anything contained in the foregoing provisions of this regulation, an operator of an aircraft to which this regulation applies may confer upon the commander of that aircraft a discretion to make, or authorise any person to make a flight in that aircraft in such circumstances that the commander or, as the case may be, that other person, will not observe the limits or will not have had the minimum rest period established by that operator under the foregoing provisions of this regulation and applicable to the commander or that other person:

Provided that the said discretion shall not be exercisable unless the following conditions are fulfilled, that is to say‐

(a)    that it appears to the commander that‐

(i)     arrangements had been made for the flight to be made with such a crew and so as to begin and end at such times that if the flight had been made in accordance with those arrangements each member of the crew would have observed the limits and have had the minimum rest periods established by the operator and applicable to them as aforesaid, and that since those arrangements were made, the flight has been or will be prevented from being made in accordance with those arrangements by reason of exceptional circumstances or by reason of circumstances which were not foreseen as likely to prevent that flight from being so made; or

(ii)    the flight is one which ought to be carried out in the interests of the safety or health of any person; and

(b)    the commander is satisfied that the safety of the aircraft on that flight will not be endangered if he or that other person makes that flight.

(7)    Every operator of an aircraft to which this regulation applies shall include in every operations manual to be provided under regulation 21 of these Regulations for the use and guidance of the members of the

flight crew of that aircraft, or in any case where no such manual is required to be provided by that regulation, in a document which shall be provided for the use and guidance of those members, full particulars of all limits and minimum rest periods for the time being established under the foregoing provisions of this regulation which may affect any of those members, and of any discretion conferred upon the commander of that aircraft under paragraph (6) of this regulation and (without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 21 of these Regulations) every such operator shall, whenever requested to

do so by a person authorised in that behalf by the Minister, furnish that person with a copy of all particulars, from time to time, included in any such operations manual or document in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph.

(8)    In this regulation, the expression "flying duty period" in relation to any person, means the time, reckoned from the beginning of each duty period of that person, in the course of which he is permitted to make any flight to which this regulation applies and after expiration of which he is not in the course of the same duty period, to make any such flight.

46.   Maximum flying duty periods for pilots and flight engineers

(1)    Without prejudice to the provisions of regulation 44 of these Regulations, a person shall not fly in an aircraft to which this regulation applies as a pilot or flight engineer thereof in the course of any duty period of that person after more than the specified time has elapsed since the beginning of that duty period.

(2)    In paragraph (1) of this regulation, the expression "the specified time" means‐

(a)    in relation to a person who flies in an aircraft as the only pilot thereof, twelve hours:

Provided that if before the commencement of that flight and during the duty period in the course of which he makes that flight, there has been a period of not less than seven continuous hours throughout which that person has not flown in any aircraft, the foregoing provisions of this subparagraph shall have effect in relation to that flight as if fourteen hours were substituted therein for twelve hours;

(b)    in relation to a person who flies as a pilot of an aircraft in which two or more persons are carried as pilots thereof, sixteen hours:

Provided that the foregoing provisions of this sub‐paragraph shallhave effect in relation to that flight as if 24 hours were substituted therein for sixteen hours if three or more persons are carried in the aircraft as pilots thereof and the following conditions are fulfilled‐

(i)     at least two of the pilots are duly qualified by their respective licences to act as a commander of the aircraft for the purposes of that flight;

(ii)    at least one of the pilots is carried in addition to those members of the flight crew who are required to be carried in the circumstances of the flight by or under these Regulations;

(iii)    suitable facilities for sleeping are available for the use of at least one of the pilots at all times throughout the flight; and

(iv)   each of the pilots has during the duty period in the course of which that flight is made and before the end of that flight, been afforded opportunities of resting for a reasonable time;

(c)    in relation to a person who flies as a flight engineer of an aircraft, sixteen hours:

Provided that the foregoing provisions of this sub‐paragraph shall have effect in relation to that flight as if 24 hours were substituted therein for sixteen hours if two or more persons are carried in the aircraft as flight engineers thereof and the following conditions are fulfilled‐

(i)     at least one of the flight engineers is carried in addition to the members of the flight crew who are required to be carried in the circumstances of the flight by or under these Regulations;

TWELFTH SCHEDULE - Minimum weather conditions for take‐off, approach to landing and landing by public transport aircraft registered in Nigeria

(1)    In this Schedule‐

"approachto landing" means that portion of the flight of the aircraft in which it is descending below a height of 1,000 feet above the critical height of the relevant minimum for landing;

"cloudceiling", in relation to an aerodrome, means the vertical distance from the elevation of the aerodrome to the lowest part of any cloud visible from the aerodrome which is sufficient to obscure more than one half of the sky so visible;

"criticalheight" means the minimum height above the elevation of the aerodrome to which an approach to landing can safely be continued without visual reference to the ground;

"minimumweather conditions", inrelation to an aerodrome, means the cloud ceiling and runway visual range for take‐offand the critical height and runway visual range for landing below which the aircraft cannot safely take off or land (as the case may be) at that aerodrome, and the expression

"relevant minimum" shall be construed accordingly;

"runwayvisual range", in relation to a runway or landing strip, means the maximum distance in the direction of take‐offor landing, as the case may be, at which the runway or landing strip or the markers or lights delineating it can be seen from a point fifteen feet above its centre line; and in the case of an aerodrome in Nigeria the distance, if any, communicated to the commander of the aircraft by or on behalf of the person in charge of the aerodrome as being the runway visual range, shall be taken to be the runway visual range for the time being;

"specified", in relation to an aircraft, means specified in or ascertainable by reference to the operations manual relating to that aircraft.

(2)    In compliance with regulation 21 (2) of these Regulations and paragraph (xiii) of Part A of the Tenth Schedule hereto the operator of every aircraft to which that regulation applies shall establish and include in the operations manual relating to the aircraft particulars of minimum weather conditions appropriate to every aerodrome of intended departure or landing and every alternate aerodrome:

Provided that, in respect of aerodromes to be used only on a flight which is not a scheduled journey or any part thereof it shall be sufficient to include in the operations manual data and instructions by means of which the appropriate minimum weather conditions can be calculated by the commander of the aircraft.

(3)    The minimum weather conditions specified shall not, in respect of any aerodrome, be less favourable than any declared in respect of that aerodrome by the competent authority, unless that authority otherwise permits in writing.

(4)    In establishing minimum weather conditions for the purpose of this regulation, the operator of the aircraft shall take into account the following matters‐

(a)    the type and performance and handling characteristics of the aircraft and any relevant conditions in its certificate of airworthiness;

(b)    the composition of its crew;

(c)    the physical characteristics of the relevant aerodrome and its  surroundings;

(d)    the dimensions of the runways which may be selected for use;

(e)    whether or not there are in use at the relevant aerodrome any aids, visual or otherwise, to assist aircraft in approach, landing, or take‐off, being aids which the crew of the aircraft are trained and equipped to use; the nature of any such aids that are in use; and the procedures for approach, landing and take‐off which may be adopted according to the existence or absence of such aids; and shall establish in relation to each runway which may be selected for use minimum weather conditions appropriate to each set of circumstances which can reasonably be expected.

(5)    With reference to regulation 24 (3) of these Regulations an aircraft shall not commence a flight at a time when‐

(a)    the cloud ceiling or the runway visual range at the aerodrome of departure is less than the minimum respectively specified for take‐off; or

(b)    according to the information available to the commander of the aircraft it would not be able, without contravening paragraph (6) of this Schedule to commence or continue an approach to landing at the aerodrome of intended destination at the estimated time of arrival there and at any alternate aerodrome at any time at which according to a reasonable estimate the aircraft would arrive there.

(6)    With reference to regulation 24 (3) of these Regulations, an aircraft shall not‐

(a)    commence or continue an approach to landing at any aerodrome if the runway visual range at that aerodrome, established or determined as aforesaid, is at the time less than the relevant minimum for landing; or

(b)    continue an approach to landing at any aerodrome by flying below the critical height of the relevant minimum for landing if from that height the approach to landing cannot be completed entirely by visual reference to the ground.

(7)    If, according to the information available, an aircraft would as regards any flight be required by the Rules of the Air and Air Traffic Control to be flown in accordance with the Instrument Flight Rules at the aerodrome of intended landing, the commander of the aircraft shall select prior to take‐off an alternate aerodrome unless no aerodrome suitable for that purpose is available.
