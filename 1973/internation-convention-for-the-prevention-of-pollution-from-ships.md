# INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION FOR THE PREVENTION OF POLLUTION FROM SHIPS, 1973

London, 2 November 1973

The Parties to the Convention,

Being conscious of the need to preserve the human environment in general and the marine environment in particular,

Recognizing that deliberate, negligent or accidental release of oil and other harmful substances from ships constitutes a serious source of pollution,

Recognizing also the importance of the International Convention for the Prevention of Polution of the Sea by Oil, 1954, as being the first multilateral instrument to be concluded with the prime objective of protecting the environment, and appreciating the significant contribution which that Convention has made in preserving the seas and coastal environment from pollution,

Desiring to achieve the complete elimination of intentional pollution of the marine environment by oil and other harmful substances and the minimization of accidental discharge of such substances,

Considering that this object may best be achieved by establishing rules not limited to oil pollution having a universal purport,

Have agreed as follows:

## Article 1

### GENERAL OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE CONVENTION

1 The Parties to the Convention undertake to give effect to the provisions of the present Convention and those Annexes thereto by which they are bound, in order to prevent the pollution of the marine environment by the discharge of harmful substances or effluents containing such substances in contravention of the Convention.

2. Unless expressly provided otherwise, a referrence to the present Convention constitutes at the same time a reference to its Protocol and to the Annexes.

## Article 4

### VIOLATION

1. Any violation of the requirements of the present Convention shall be prohibited and sanctions shall be established therefor under the law of the Administration of the ship concerned wherever the violation occurs. If the Adminsitration is informed of such a violation and is satisfied that sufficient evidence is available to enable proceedings to be brought in respect of the alleged violation, it shall cause such proceedings to be taken as soon as possible, in accordance with its law.

Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of the present Article a certificate issued under the authority of a Party to the Convention in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations shall be accepted by the other Parties and regarded for all purposes covered by the present Convention as having the same validity as a certificate issued by them.

2. A ship required to hold a certificate in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations is subject, while in the ports or off-shore terminals under the jurisdiction of a Party, to inspection by officers duly authorized by that Party. Any such inspection shall be limited to verfying that there is on board a valid certificate, unless there are clear grounds for believing that the condition of the ship or its equipment does not correspond substantially with the particulars of that certificate. In that case, or if the ship does not carry a valid certificate the Party carrying out the inspection shall take such steps as will ensure that the ship shall not sail until it can proceed to sea without presenting an unreasonable threat of harm to the marine environment. 
That Party may, however, grant such a ship permission to leave the port or off-shore terminal for the purpose of proceedings to the nearest appropriate repair yard available.

3. If a Party denies a foreign ship entry to the ports or off-shore terminals under its jurisdiction or takes any action against such a ship for the reason that the ship does not comply with the provisions of the present Convention, the Party shall immediately inform the consul or diplomatic representative of the Party whose flag the ship is entitled to fly, or if this is not possible, the Administration of the ship concerned. Before denying entry or taking such action the Party may request consultation with the Administration of the ship concerned. Information shall also be given to the Administration when a ship does not carry a valid certificate in accordance with the provisions of the Regulations.

If an inspection indicates a violation of the Convention, a report shall be forwarded to the Administration for any appropriate action.

3. Any Party shall furnish to the Administration evidence, if any, that the ship had discharged harmful substances in violation of the provisions of the Regulations. If it is practicable to do so, the competent authority of the former Party shall notify the Master of the ship of the alleged violation.

4. Upon receiving such evidence, the Administration so informed shall investigate the matter, and may request the other Party to furnish further or better evidence of the alleged contravention. If the Administration is satisfied that sufficient evidence is available to enable proceedings to be brought in respect of the alleged violation, it shall cause such proceedings to be taken in accordance with its law as soon as possible. The Administration shall promptly inform the Party which has reported the alleged violation, as well as the Organization, of the action taken.

5. A Party may also inspect a ship to which the present Convention applies when it enters the ports or off-shore terminals under its jurisdiction, if a request for an investigation is received from any Party together with sufficient evidence that the ship has discharged harmful substances or effluents containing such substances in any place. The report of such investigation shall be sent to the Party requesting it and to the Administration so that the appropriate action may be taken under the present Convention.

c) The arrangements of the slop tank or combination of slop tanks shall have a capacity necessary to retain the slops generated by tank washing, oil residues and dirty ballast residues but the total shall be not less than 3 per cent of the oil carrying capacity of the ship, except that, where segregated ballast tanks are provided in accordance with Regulation 13 of this Annex, or where arrangements such as eductors involving the use of water additional to the washing water are not fitted, the Administration may accept 2 per cent. New oil tankers over 70,000 tons deadweight shall be provided with at least two slop tanks.

d) Slop tanks shall be designed particularly in respect of the position of inlets, outlets, baffles or where fitted, so as to avoid excessive turbulence and entrainment of oil or emulsion with the water.

3. a) An oil discharge monitoring and control system approved by the Administration shall be fitted. In considering the design of the oil content meter to be incorported in the system, the Administration shall have regard to the specification recommended by the Organization.*

* Reference is made to "Clean Seas Guide for Oil Tankers", 
published by the International Chamber of Shipping and the Oil Companies International Marine Forum.

The system shall be fitted with a recording device to provide a continuous record of the discharge in litres per nautical mile and total quantity discharged, or the oil content and rate of discharge. This record shall be identifiable as to time and date and shall be kept for at least three years. The oil discharge monitor and control system shall come into operation when there is any discharge of effluent into the sea and shall be such as will ensure that any discharge of oily mixture is automatically stopped when the instantaneous rate of discharge of oil exceeds that permitted by Regulation 9(1)(a) of this Annex. Any failure of this monitoring and control system shall stop the discharge and be noted in the Oil Record Book. A manually operated alternative method shall be provided and may be used in the event of such failure, but the defective unit shall be made operable before the oil tanker commences its next ballast voyage unless it is proceeding to a repair port. Existing oil tankers shall comply with all of the provisions specified above except that the stopping of the discharge may be performed manually and the rate of discharge may be estimated from the pump characteristic.

b) Effective oil/water interface detectors approved by the Administration shall be provided for a rapid and accurate determination of the oil/water interface in slop tanks and shall be available for use in other tanks where the separation of oil and water is effected and from which it is intended to discharge effluent direct to the sea.

They shall cover manual as well as automatic operations and shall be intended to ensure that at no time shall oil be discharged except in compliance with the conditions specified in Regulation 9 of this Annex.*

* Reference is made to the Recommendation on International Performance Specifications for Oily-Water Separating Equipment and Oil Content Meters adopted by the Organization by Resolution A.233 (VII).

4. The requirements of paragraphs (1), (2) and (3 ) of this Regulation shall not apply to oil tankers of less than 150 tons gross tonnage, for which the control of discharge of oil under Regulation 9 of this Annex shall be effected by the retention of oil on board with subsequent discharge of all contaminated washings to reception facilities. The total quantity of oil and water used for washing and returned to a storage tank shall be recorded in the Oil Record Book. This total quantity shall be discharged to reception facilities unless adequate arrangements are made to ensure that any effluent which is allowed to be discharged into the sea is effectively monitored to ensure that the provision of Regulation 9 of this Annex are complied with.

5. The Administration may waive the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this Regulation for any oil tanker which engages exclusively on voyages both of 72 hours or less in duration and within 50 miles from the nearest land, provided that the oil tanker is not required to hold and does not hold an International Oil Pollution Prevention Certificate (1973). Any such waiver shall be subject to the requirements that the oil tanker shall retain on board all oily mixtures for subsequent discharge to reception facilities and to the determination by the Administration that facilities available to receive such oily mixtures are adequate.

6. Where in the view of the Organization equipment required by Regulation 9(1)(a)(vi) of this Annex and specified in sub-
paragraph (3)(a) of this Regulation is not obtainable for the monitoring of discharge of light refined products (white oils), the Administration may waive compliance with such procedures established by the Organization which shall satisfy the conditions of Regulation 9(1)(a) of this Annex except the obligation to have an oil discharge monitoring and control system in operation. The Organization shall review the availability of equipment at intervals not exceeding twelve months.

Chapter III

REQUIREMENTS FOR MINIMIZING OIL POLLUTION FROM OIL TANKERS DUE TO SIDE AND BOTTOM DAMAGES

#### Regulation 22

DAMAGE ASSUMPTIONS

1. For the purpose of calculating hypothetical oil outflow from oil tankers, three dimensions of the extent of damage of a parallelepiped on the side and bottom of the ship are assumed as follows. In the case of bottom damages two conditions are set forth to be applied individually to the stated portions of the oil tanker.

a) Side damage

(i) Longitudinal  1/3 L 2/3 or 14.5 metres,
     extent (lc);  whichever is less

(ii) Transverse	  B/5 or 11.5 metres,
     extent (lc):   whichever is less

   (inboard from the
   ship's side at right
   angles to the
   centre-line at the
   level correspond-
   ing to the assigned
   summer freeboard)

(iii) Vertical       from the base line
   extent (vc):      upwards without limit

b) Bottom damage
             For 0.3L from     Any other part
             the forward       of the ship
             perpendicular
             of the ship

 (i) Long-    L/10             L/10 or 5 metres,
     itudinal                  whichever is less
     extent (ls)

(ii) Trans-   B/6 or 10 metres, 5 metres
     verse    whichever is less but not less
     extent   than 5 metres
     (ts) 

(iii) Vertical  B or 6 metres,
     extent
     from the   whichever is less
     base  
     line (vs):

2. Whenever the symbols given in this Regulation appear in this Chapter, they have the meaning as defined in this Regulation.


Regulation 23 

HYPOTHETICAL OUTFLOW OF OIL 

1. The hypothetical outflow of oil in the case of side damage 
(Oc) and bottom damage (Os) shall be calculated by the following formulae with respect to compartments breached by damage to all conceivable locations along the length of the ship to the extent as defined in Regulation 22 of this Annex. 

a) for side damages: 

Oc = sigmaW1 + sigmaK1C1         (I)

b) for bottom damages: 

Os = 1/3(sigmaZ1W1 + sigmaZ1C1) (II)

where:

Wi = volume of a wing tank in cubic metres assumed to be breached by the damage as specified in Regulation 22 of this Annex; Wi for a segregated ballast tank may be taken equal to zero.

Ci = volume of a centre tank in cubic metres assumed to be breached by the damage as specified in Regulation 22 of this Annex; Ci for a segregated ballast tank may be taken equal to zero.

Ki = 1 - bi/tc  when bi is equal to or greater than tc, Ki shall be taken equal to zero,

Zi = 1 - hi/vs when hi is equal to or greater than vs, Zi shall be taken equal to zero,

bi= width of wing tank in metres under consideration measured inboard from the ship's side at right angles to the centreline at the level corresponding to the assigned summer freeboard,

hi = minimum depth of the double bottom in metres under consideration; where no double bottom is fitted hi shall be taken to be equal to zero.

Whenever symbols given in this paragraph appear in the Chapter, they have the meaning as defined in this Regulation.

2. If a void space or segregated ballast tank of a length less than lc as defined in Regulation 22 of this Annex is located between wing oil tanks, Oc in formula 
(1) may be calculated on the basis of volume Wi being the actual volume of one such tank (where they are of equal capacity) or the smaller of the two tanks (if they differ in capacity) adjacent to such space, multiplied by Si as defined below and taking for all other wing tanks involved in such a collision the value of the actual full volume.

Si = 1 - li/lc

where li = length in metres of void space or segregated ballast tank under consideration.

3. a) Credit shall only be given in respect of double bottom tanks which are either empty or carrying clean water when cargo is carried in the tanks above.

b) Where the double bottom does not extent for the full length and width of the tank involved, the double bottom is considered non-existent and the volume of the tanks above the area of the bottom damage shall be included in formula (II) 
even if the tank is not considered breached because of the installation of such a partial double bottom.

c) Suction wells may be neglected in the determination of the value hi provided such wells are not excessive in area and extend below the tank for a minimum distance and in no case more than half the height of the double bottom. If the depth of such a well exceeds half the height of the double bottom, hi shall be taken equal to the double bottom height minus the well height.

 Piping serving such wells if installed within the double bottom shall be fitted with valves or other closing arrangements located at the point of connextion to the tank served to prevent oil outflow in the event of damage to the piping. Such piping shall be installed as high from the bottom shell as possible. These valves shall be kept closed at sea at any time when the tank contains oil cargo, except that they may be opened only for cargo transfer needed for the purpose of trimming of the ship.

4. In the case where bottom damage simultaneously involves four centre tanks, the value of Os may be calculated according to the formula

Os = 1/4(sigmaZiWi + sigmaZiCi) (III)

5. An Administration may credit as reducing oil outflow in case of bottom damage, an installed cargo transfer system having an emergency high suction in each cargo oil tank, capable of transferring from a breached tank or tanks to segregated ballast tanks or to available cargo tankage if it can be assured that such tanks will have sufficient ullage. 
Credit for such a system would be governed by ability to transfer in two hours of operation oil equal to one half of the largest of the breached tanks involved and by availability of equivalent receiving capacity in ballast or cargo tanks. The credit shall be confined to permitting calculation of Os according to formula (III). The pipes for such suctions shall be installed at least at a height not less than the vertical extent of the bottom damage vs. The Administration shall supply the Organization with the information concerning the arrangements accepted by it, for circulation to other Parties to the Convention.

#### Regulation 24

LIMITATION OF SIZE AND ARRANGEMENT OF CARGO TANKS

1. Every new oil tanker shall comply with the provision of this Regulation. Every existing oil tanker shall be required, within two years after the date of entry into force of the present Convention, to comply with the provisions of this Regulation if such a tanker falls into either of the following categories:

a) a tanker, the delivery of which is after 1 January 1977; 
or

b) a tanker to which both the following conditions apply:

(i) delivery is not later than 1 January 1977; and

(ii) the building contract is placed after 1 January 1974, or in cases where no building contract has previously been placed, the keel is laid or the tanker is at a similar stage of construction after 30 January 1974.

2. Cargo tanks of oil tankers shall be of such size and arrangements that the hypothetical outflow Oc or Os calculated in accordance with the provisions of Regulation 23 of this Annex anywhere in the length of the ship does not exceed 30,000 cubic metres or 400 x cube root of DW, whichever is the greater, but subject to a maximum of 40,000 cubic metres.

3. The volume of any one wing cargo oil tank of an oil tanker shall not exceed seventy-five per cent of the limits of the hypothetical oil outflow referred to in paragraph (2) of this Regulation. The volume of any one centre cargo oil tank shall not exceed 50,000 cubic metres. However, in segregated ballast oil tankers as defined in Regulation 13 of this Annex, the permitted volume of a wing cargo oil tank situated between two segregated ballast tanks, each exceeding lc in length, may be increased to the maximum limit of hypothetical oil outflow provided that the width of the wing tanks exceeds tc.

4. The length of each cargo tank shall not exceed 10 metres or one of the following values, whichever is the greater:
a) where no longitudinal bulkhead is provided:
  
   0.1L

b) where a longitudinal bulkhead is provided at the centreline only:
  
   0.15L

c) where two or more longitudinal bulkheads are provided:

(i) for wing tanks:
    0.2L 

(ii) for centre tanks:
     (1) if bi Ñ B is equal to or greater than 1/5:

     0.2L B

     (2) if bi/B is less than 1/5:

Ñ where no centreline longitudinal bulkhead is provided:
       
    (0.5 bi/B + 0.1)L

Ñwhere a centreline longitudinal bulkhead is provided:
     
(0.25 bi/B + 0.15)L

5. In order not to exceed the volume limits established by paragraphs (2), (3) and (4) of this Regulation and irrespective of the accepted type of cargo transfer system installed, when such a system inter-connects two or more cargo tanks, valves or other similar closing devices shall be provided for separating the tanks from each other. These valves or devices shall be closed when the tanker is at sea. 

6. Lines of piping which run through cargo tanks in a position less than tc from the ship's side or less than vc from the ship's bottom shall be fitted with valves or similar closing devices at the point at which they open into any cargo tank. These valves shall be kept closed at sea at any time when the tanks contain cargo oil, except that they may be opened only for cargo transfer needed for the purpose of trimming of the ship.

#### Regulation 25

SUBDIVISION AND STABILITY

1. Every new oil tanker shall comply with the subdivision and damage stability criteria as specified in paragraph (3) of this Regulation, after the assumed side or bottom damage as specified in paragraph (2) of this Regualtion, for any operating draught reflecting actual partial or full load conditions consistent with trim and strength of the ship as well as specific gravities of the cargo. Such damage shall be applied to all conceivable locations along the length of the ship as follows:

a) in tankers of more than 225 metres in length, anywhere in the ship's length;

b) in tankers of more than 150 metres, but not exceeding 225 metres in length, anywhere in the ship's length except involving either after or forward bulkhead bounding the machinery space located aft. The machinery space shall be treated as a single floodable compartment;

c) in tankers not exceeding 150 metres in length, anywhere in the ship's length between adjacent transverse bulkheads with the exception of the machinery space. For tankers of 100 metres or less in length where all requirements of paragraph (3) of this Regulation cannot be fulfilled without materially impairing the operational qualities of the ship, Administrations may allow relaxations from these requirements.

Ballast conditions where the tanker is not carrying oil in cargo tanks excluding any oil residues, shall not be considered.

2. The following provisions regarding the extent and the character of the assumed damage shall apply:

a) The extent of side or bottom damage shall be as specified in Regulation 22 of this Annex, except that the longitudinal extent of the bottom damage within 0.3L from the forward perpendicular shall be the same as for side damage, as specified in Regulation 22 (1)(a)(i) of this Annex. If any damage of lesser extent results in a more severe condition such damage shall be assumed.

b) Where the damage involving transverse bulkheads is envisaged as specified in subparagraphs (1)(a) and (b) of this Regulation, transverse watertight bulkheads shall be spaced at least at a distance equal to the longitudinal extent of assumed damage specified in sub-paragraph (a) of this paragraph in order to be considered effective. Where transverse bulkheads are spaced at a lesser distance, one or more of these bulkheads within such extent of damage shall be assumed as non-existent for the purpose of determining flooded compartments.

c) Where the damage between adjacent transverse watertight bulkheads is envisaged as specified in sub-paragraph (1)(c) 
of this Regulation, no main transverse bulkhead or a transverse bulkhead bounding side tanks or double bottom tanks shall be assumed damaged, unless:

(i) the spacing of the adjacent bulkheads is less than the longitudinal extent of assumed damage specified in sub-
paragraph (a) of this paragraph; or
(ii) there is a step or a recess in a transverse bulkhead of more than 3.05 metres in length, located within the extent of penetration of assumed damage. The step forward by the after peak bulkhead and after peak tank top shall not be regarded as a step for the purpose of this Regulation.

d) If pipes, ducts or tunnels are situated within the assumed extent of damage, arrangements shall be made so that progressive flooding cannot thereby extend to compartments other than those assumed to be floodable for each case of damage.

3. Oil tankers shall be regarded as complying with the damage stability criteria if the following requirements are met:

a) The final waterline, taking into account sinkage, heel and trim, shall be below the lower edge of any opening through which progressive flooding may take place. Such openings shall include air pipes and those which are closed by means of weathertight doors or hatch covers and may exclude those openings closed by means of watertight manhole covers and flush scuttles, small watertight cargo tank hatch covers which maintain the high integrity of the deck, remotely operated watertight sliding doors, and side scuttles of the non-opening type,

b) In the final stage of flooding, the angle of heel due to unsymmetrical flooding shall not exceed 25 degrees, provided that this angle may be increased up to 30 degrees if no deck edge immersion occurs.

c) The stability in the final stage of flooding shall be investigated and may be regarded as sufficient if the righting lever curve has at least a range of 20 degrees beyond the position of equilibrium in association with a maximum residual righting lever of at least 0.1 metre. The Administration shall give consideration to the potential hazard presented by protected or unprotected openings which may become temporarily immersed within the range of residual stability.

d) The Administration shall be satisfied that the stability is sufficient during intermediate stages of flooding.

4. The requirements of paragraph (1) of this Regulation shall be confirmed by calculations which take into consideration the design characteristics of the ship, the arrangements, configuration and contents of the damaged compartments; and the distribution, specific gravities and the free surface effect of liquids. The calculations shall be based on the following:

a) Account shall be taken of any empty or partially filled tank, the specific gravity of cargoes carried, as well as any outflow of liquids from damaged compartments.

b) The permeabilities are assumed as follows:

Spaces	              Permeability

Appropriated to	     0.60
 stores

Occupied by	          0.95
 accommodation

Occupied by machinery   0.85

Voids	               0.95

Intended for	          0 to 0.95*
 consumable liquids

Intended for	          0 to 0.95**
 other liquids

* Whichever results in the more severe requirements.

** The permeability of partially filled compartments shall be consistent with the amount of liquid carried.

c) The buoyancy of any superstructure directly above the side damage shall be disregarded. The unflooded parts of superstructures beyond the extent of damage, however, may be taken into consideration provided that they are separated from the damaged space by watertight bulkheads and the requirements of sub-paragraph (3)(a) of this Regulation in respect of these intact spaces are complied with. Hinged watertight doors may be acceptable in watertight bulkheads in the superstructure.

d) The free surface effect shall be calculated at an angle of heel of 5 degrees for each individual compartment. The Administration may require or allow the free surface corrections to be calculated at an angle of heel greater than 5 degrees for partially filled tanks.

e) In calculating the effect of free surfaces of consumable liquids it shall be assumed that, for each type of liquid at least one transverse pair or a single centreline tank has a free surface and the tank or combination of tanks to be taken into account shall be those where the effect of free surfaces is the greatest.

5. The Master of every oil tanker and the person in charge of a non-self-propelled oil tanker to which this Annex applies shall be supplied in an approved form with:

a) information relative to loading and distribution of cargo necessary to ensure compliance with the provisions of this Regulation; and

b) data on the ability of the ship to comply with damage stability criteria as determined by this Regulation, including the effect of relaxations that may have been allowed under sub-paragraph (1)(c) of this Regulation.

### ANNEX II

REGULATIONS FOR THE CONTROL OF POLLUTION BY NOXIOUS LIQUID IN BULK

#### Regulation 1

DEFINITIONS

For the purposes of this Annex:

1. "Chemical tanker" means a ship constructed or adapted primarily to carry a cargo of noxious liquid substances in bulk and includes an "oil tanker" as defined in Annex I of the present Convention when carrying a cargo or part cargo of noxious liquid substances in bulk.

2. "Clean ballast" means ballast carried in a tank which, since it was last used to carry a cargo containing a substance in Category A, B, C or D has been thoroughly cleaned and the residues resulting therefrom have been discharged and the tank emptied in accordance with the appropriate requirements of this Annex.

3. "Segregated ballast" means ballast water introduced into a tank permanently allocated to the carriage of ballast or to the carriage of ballast or cargoes other than oil or noxious liquid substances as variously defined in the Annexes of the present Convention, and which is completely separated from the cargo and oil fuel system.

4. "Nearest land" is as defined in Regulation 1(9) of Annex I of the present Convention.

5. "Liquid substances" are those having a vapour pressure not exceeding 2.8 kp/cm1 at a temperature of 37.8¡C.

6. "Noxious liquid substance" means any substance designated in Appendix II to this Annex or provisionally assessed under the provisions of Regulation 3 (4) as falling into Category A, B, C or D.

7. "Special area" means a sea area where for recognized technical reasons in relation to its oceanographic and ecological condition and to its peculiar transportation traffic the adoption of special mandatory methods for the prevention of sea pollution by noxious liquid substances is required.

  Special areas shall be:

a) The Baltic Sea Area, and

b) The Black Sea Area.

8. "Baltic Sea Area" is as defined in Regulation 10(1)(b) of Annex I of the present Convention.

9. "Black Sea Area" is as defined in Regulation 10(1)(c) of Annex I of the present Convention.

#### Regulation 2

APPLICATION

1. Unless expressly provided otherwise the provisions of this Annex shall apply to all ships carrying noxious liquid substances in bulk.

2. Where a cargo subject to the provisions of Annex I of the present Convention is carried in a cargo space of a chemical tanker, the appropriate requirements of Annex I of the present Convention shall also apply.

3. Regulation 13 of this Annex shall apply only to ships carrying substances which are categorized for discharge control purposes in Category A, B or C.

#### Regulation 3

CATEGORIZATION AND LISTING OF NOXIOUS LIQUID SUBSTANCES

1. For the purpose of the Regulation of this Annex, except Regulation 13, noxious liquid substances shall be divided into four categories as follows:

a) Category A Ñ Noxious liquid substances which if discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations would present a major hazard to either marine resources or human health or cause serious harm to amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea and therefore justify the application of stringent anti-pollution measures.

b) Category B Ñ Noxious liquid substances which if discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations would present a hazard to either marine resources or human health or cause harm to amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea and therefore justify the application of special anti-pollution measures.

c) Category C Ñ Noxious liquid substances which if discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations would present a minor hazard to either marine resources or human health or cause minor harm to amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea and therefore require special operational conditions.

d) Category D Ñ Noxious liquid substances which if discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations would present a recognizable hazard to either marine resources or human health or cause minimal harm to amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea and therefore require some attention in operational conditions.

2. Guidelines for use in the categorization of noxious liquid substances are given in Appendix I to this Annex.

3. The list of noxious liquid substances carried in bulk and presently categorized which are subject to the provisions of this Annex is set out in Appendix II to this Annex.

4. Where it is proposed to carry a liquid substance in bulk which has not been categorized under paragraph (1) of this Regulation or evaluated as referred to in Regulation 4(1) of this Annex, the Governments of Parties to the Convention involved in the proposed operation shall establish and agree on a provisional assessment for the proposed operation on the basis of the guidelines referred to in paragraph (2) of this Regulation. Until full agreement between the Governments involved has been reached, the substance shall be carried under the most severe conditions proposed. As soon as possible, but not later than ninety days after its first carriage, the Administration concerned shall notify the Organization and provide details of the substance and the provisional assessment for prompt circulation to all Parties for their information and consideration. The Government of each Party shall have a period of ninety days in which to forward its comments to the Organization, with a view to the assessment of the substance.

#### Regulation 4

OTHER LIQUID SUBSTANCES

1. The substances listed in Appendix III to this Annex have been evaluated and found to fall outside the Categories A, B, C and D, as defined in Regulation 3(1) of this Annex because they are presently considered to present no harm to human health, marine resources, amenities or other legitimate uses of the sea, when discharged into the sea from tank cleaning or deballasting operations.

2. The discharge of bilge or ballast water or other residues or mixtures containing only substances listed in Appendix Ill to this Annex shall not be subject to any requirement of this Annex.

3. The discharge into the sea of clean ballast or segregated ballast shall not be subject to any requirement of this Annex.

#### Regulation 1

APPLICATION

1. Unless expressly provided otherwise, the Regulations of this Annex apply to all ships carrying harmful substances in packaged forms, or in freight containers, portable tanks or road and rail tank wagons.

2. Such carriage of harmful substances is prohibited except in accordance with the provisions of this Annex.

3. To supplement the provisions of this Annex the Government of each Party to the Convention shall issue, or cause to be issued, detailed requirements on packaging, marking and labelling, documentation, stowage, quantity limitations, exceptions and notification, for preventing or minimizing pollution of the marine environment by harmful substances.

4. For the purpose of this Annex, empty receptacles, freight containers, portable tanks and road and rail tank wagons which have been used previously for the carriage of harmful substances shall themselves be treated as harmful substances unless adequate precautions have been taken to ensure that they contain no residue that is hazardous to the marine environment.

#### Regulation 2

PACKAGING

 Packagings, freight containers, portable tanks and road and rail tank wagons shall be adequate to minimize the hazard to the marine environment having regard to their specific contents.

#### Regulation 3

MARKING AND LABELLING

 Packages, whether shipped individually or in units or in freight containers, portable tanks or road and rail tank wagons containing a harmful substance, shall be durably marked with the correct technical name (trade names shall not be used as the correct technical name), and further marked with a distinctive label or stencil of label, indicating that the contents are harmful. Such identification shall be supplemented where possible by any other means, for example by the use of the United Nations number.

#### Regulation 4

DOCUMENTATION

1. In all documents relating to the carriage of harmful substances by sea where such substances are named, the correct technical name of the substances shall be used (trade names shall not be used).

2. The shipping documents supplied by the shipper shall include a certificate or declaration that the shipment offered for carriage is properly packed, marked and labelled and in proper condition for carriage to minimize the hazard to the marine environment.

3. Each ship carrying harmful substances shall have a special list or manifest setting forth the harmful substances on board and the location thereof. A detailed stowage plan which sets out the location of all harmful substances on board may be used in place of such special list or manifest. Copies of such documents shall also be retained on shore by the owner of the ship or his representative until the harmful substances are unloaded.

4. In a case where the ship carries a special list or manifest or a detailed stowage plan, required for the carriage of dangerous goods by the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea in force, the documents required for the purpose of this Annex may be combined with those for dangerous goods. Where documents are combined, a clear distinction shall be made between dangerous goods and other harmful substances.
