(b)    where there is no surviving spouse eligible for monthly payments under this section, and the-

(i)     dependant is a child, a monthly payment of a sum equal to 40 per cent of the total monthly rate of compensation under this Act that would have been payable if the deceased employee had, at the date of death, sustained a permanent total disability,

(ii)    dependants are 2 children, a monthly payment of a sum equal to 60 per cent of the monthly rate or compensation under this Act that would have been payable if the deceased employee had, at the date of death, sustained a permanent total disability, or

(d)    where the surviving child is disabled, the Board shall determine the period of the monthly payment for such time as the Board believes that the disabled child would not have been dependent on the deceased employee;

(e)    where the deceased employee does not leave a dependent spouse or child entitled to compensation under this section, but leaves other dependants or next of kins who were wholly dependent on him or her, the Board shall determine a sum reasonable and proportionate to the pecuniary loss suffered by such dependants or next of kins by reason of death of the employee;

(f)     where -

(i)     no compensation is payable under subsection (1) (a)-(e) of this section; or

(ii)    the compensation is payable only to a spouse, a child or children or a parent or parents; but the employee leaves a spouse, child or parent who, though not dependent on the remuneration of the employee at the time of the death of the employee, had a reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit from the continuation of the life of the employee, the Board shall make monthly payment of an amount to be determined by the Board to such spouse, child or children, parent or parents; and

(2)    Where a disabled spouse ceases to be disabled, or a widow or widower with dependent children no longer has dependent children or there is a reduction in the number of dependent children, the spouse, widow, widower or children shall be entitled to the same category of benefits as would have been payable if the death of the employee had occurred on the date the disabled spouse ceases to be disabled or the widow or widower no longer has dependent children or the number of dependent children is reduced, as the case may be.

(3)    Where there is a widow or widower and a child or children, and the widow or widower subsequently dies, the allowances to the children shall, if they are in other respects eligible, continue and be calculated in the same manner as if the employee had died leaving no dependent spouse.

(ii)    separated with the intention of living separate and apart for a period of 3 months or longer preceding the death of the employee, monthly payments shall be made up to the level of support which the Board believes the spouse and those children would have been likely to receive from the employee if the death had not occurred.

(8)    The compensation payable under sub-section (7) of this section shall not exceed the compensation that would have been payable under subsection (1) of this section had there been no separation.

(a)    no children, for a period of3 years; or

(b)    children, for a period of one year, immediately preceding the death of the employee, and where the employee does not leave a dependent widow or widower, the Board may pay the compensation to which a dependent widow or widower would have been entitled under this Act to the wife or husband,
